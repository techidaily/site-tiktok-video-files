The product, known as the Ultrastar Transporter, is a new Western Digital-built travel case that houses a whopping 368TB of NVMe flash storage. The case is TAA compliant and has a 12-core Intel Ice Lake server that houses all SSDs and dual 200Gb ethernet ports.</p><p> The Ultrastar Transporter briefcase addresses high-performance, high-capacity data transfers between server and edge locations. Western Digital reports that demand is high for physical storage transport, particularly vast amounts of data that would take days or weeks to transfer over the Internet. WD’s new travel case solves this problem by allowing users to transport vast data through good old physical transportation.</p><p> Image 1 of 2</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Western Digital Ultrastar Transporter"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Western Digital)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Western Digital Ultrastar Transporter"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Western Digital)</p><p> A few examples include workloads where high-capacity data capture needs to be processed at one location from another. Another is the proliferation of multi-datacenter workflows, where large data sets have to be held at multiple locations and rapidly sent to those locations faster than what raw internet bandwidth can provide.</p><p> The Ultrastar Transporter has a rackmount server that holds all 368TB of NVMe flash storage to accommodate all that storage. The server features a 12-core Intel<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-10nm-ice-lake-test-benchmarks,6257.html" >Ice Lake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Xeon 4310 CPU, 128GB of DDR4 RDIMM memory, 1300W Titanium PSU, and dual 2TB SN740 NVMe SSDs in Raid 1, which serve as the boot drive. I&#x2F;O consists of dual 200GB ethernet ports, dual USB 3.0 ports, a DB9 serial port, and a VGA port. 7 PCIe Gen4 slots are located on the board, including four x16 slots and three x8 slots. These PCIe slots connect all 368TB of SSD storage to the system.</p><p> The case itself looks like a conventional carrying case. The outer shell appears to be hard plastic, with metal supporting rails filling the lips of the case. The case features two latching mechanisms and a mechanism to attach a lock for<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security" >security <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

This tiny PC weighs just 2.6 kg and comes in a 2.5-liter chassis that measures 270 x 180 x 50mm. Even though it has a diminutive form factor, you won’t miss out on performance as it comes with either an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H or a Core Ultra 9 185H. Both models also have a discrete GPU — an RTX 4060 for the Ultra 7 and RTX 4070 for the Ultra 9.</p><p> Intel left the mini-PC business in July 2023, licensing its<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nuc-is-now-officially-part-of-the-asus-product-lineup" >NUC brand <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Asus and allowing it to continue the line of tiny computers. Asus teased an<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/asus-teases-rog-nuc-ready-to-be-unveiled-on-january-8" >ROG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> version of the NUC in January 2024, and after six months, it’s finally ready to release a retail version of its first gaming mini-PC.</p><p>These are the specifications of the two Asus ROG NUC models:</p><p> Swipe to scroll horizontally</p><table><thead><tr><th>Model #</th><th>RNUC14SRKU7168AUI</th><th>RNUC14SRKU9189AUI</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Intel Core Ultra 7 155H</td><td>Intel Core Ultra 9 185H</td></tr><tr><td>Graphics Card</td><td>RTX 4060</td><td>RTX 4070</td></tr><tr><td>Memory [Upgradeable to (32GB x 2)]</td><td>(8GB x 2) DDR5-5600</td><td>(8GB x 2) DDR5-5600</td></tr><tr><td>Storage [3x M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4x4 slots available]</td><td>1x 512GB M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4x4</td><td>512GB M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4x4</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless</td><td>Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3</td><td>Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3</td></tr><tr><td>LAN</td><td>2.5G Intel LAN</td><td>2.5G Intel LAN</td></tr><tr><td>Audio</td><td>Realtek&#x2F;ALC256</td><td>Realtek&#x2F;ALC256</td></tr><tr><td>Front I&#x2F;O Ports</td><td>1x SD Card Reader, 2x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A, 1x 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack</td><td>1x SD Card Reader, 2x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A, 1x 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack</td></tr><tr><td>Rear I&#x2F;O Ports</td><td>1x Thunderbolt 4&#x2F;USB4 Type-C port (with DP2.1 and 12V fast charging), 2x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A, 2x USB 2.0 Type-A, 1x HDMI 2.1, 2x DP1.4a port, 1x 2.5G RJ45 LAN, 1x DC in barrel jack port, 1x Kensington Lock slot</td><td>1x Thunderbolt 4&#x2F;USB4 Type-C port (with DP2.1 and 12V fast charging), 2x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A, 2x USB 2.0 Type-A, 1x HDMI 2.1, 2x DP1.4a port, 1x 2.5G RJ45 LAN, 1x DC in barrel jack port, 1x Kensington Lock slot</td></tr><tr><td>Power Supply</td><td>330W power adapter</td><td>330W power adapter</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>$1,629.00</td><td>$2,199.00</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Since this is also an ROG product, you get gaming-specific features, like ARGB lights on the ROG logo at the top or side panel (depending on how you orient the mini-PC). Asus even says that you have the option to create your own logo, although there’s no indication yet of how to do that.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Although the ROG NUC is a tiny computer, it can accommodate up to four 4K displays via the HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB4 ports. However, we wouldn’t recommend that configuration for gaming as an RTX 4070 might be a little bit hard-pressed to deliver that many pixels.</p><p> You can now see both devices on the<a class="link"   href="https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=332082&a=2384895&epi=tomshardware-us-6479410811963061514&url=https://rog.asus.com/us/desktops/mini-pc/rog-nuc/" >Asus website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but they’re marked as ‘Temporarily Out of Stock.’ Nevertheless, if you’re looking for a tiny gaming PC, you can ask Asus to notify you when they become available. You should also prepare your wallet if you want this device with its high starting price. It does come with a discrete GPU, though, unlike other mini-PC designs, where you need an eGPU dock to enjoy high-quality graphics.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp;

In fact, unlike Instagram, which offers a limited selection of filters and effects to test, TikTok has an extensive library of filters and effects to attempt.</p><p>TikTok filters alter the look and feel of your videos. You may, however, add stuff to your films using effects. You may entirely transform the look of your videos by applying TikTok filters.

This filter flips any video you capture, and it’s famous for using the front-facing camera because it’s said to mimic how other people perceive you. So, what’s the big deal about it? On the other hand, the inverted filter has enraged some users, who don’t always appreciate their “true” reflection. However, the only way to see what all the fuss (or hysteria) is about is to give it a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-inverted-filter.jpg"                      alt="tiktok inverted filter"                ></p><h3 id="8-TikTok’s-Face-Zoom-effect"><a href="#8-TikTok’s-Face-Zoom-effect" class="headerlink" title="8.TikTok’s Face Zoom effect"></a>8.TikTok’s Face Zoom effect</h3><p>As the name suggests, the Face Zoom effect zooms-in on your face. Some people use it in group videos to see which face the filter lands on, while others use the same to compare how you look up close versus how you look from a distance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-face-zoom-effect.jpg"                      alt="tiktok face zoom effect"                ></p><h3 id="9-TikTok’s-Face-Morph"><a href="#9-TikTok’s-Face-Morph" class="headerlink" title="9.TikTok’s Face Morph"></a>9.TikTok’s Face Morph</h3><p>The Face Morph effect is another popular effect. This one lets you morph and transition between multiple images of someone else’s face. The effect may be under TikTok’s Templates area because it employs graphics rather than video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-face-morph.jpg"                      alt="tiktok face morph"                ></p><h3 id="10-TikTok’s-Beauty-Filter"><a href="#10-TikTok’s-Beauty-Filter" class="headerlink" title="10.TikTok’s Beauty Filter"></a>10.TikTok’s Beauty Filter</h3><p>For obvious reasons, the Beauty filter is popular on TikTok.

It’s commonly useful in conjunction with other filters and effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-beauty-filter.jpeg"                      alt="tiktok beauty filter"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Use-of-Filters-for-TikTok-by-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Use-of-Filters-for-TikTok-by-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make Use of Filters for TikTok by Filmora?"></a>Part 2: How to Make Use of Filters for TikTok by Filmora?</h2><p>Wondershare’s Filmora video editor features the standard overlays, transitions, editing, and effects that we’ve come to expect from enthusiast-level video editors.

Memes and videos are appealing to watch, although better ones are released virtually every day for inspiration. numerous musicians included as they acquire recognition. Their tunes and hits delighted viewers, and songs earned prominence. Most individuals obtained followers via popular videos that were often featured on the subscribers’ lists. Get inspired by the newest <strong>anime TikTok</strong> trends and discover how to spot upcoming trends to boost your company or personal account.</p><p>Something that appears perennially groovy one moment might be insufferable the next — like, say, wearing fedoras or Kreepa’s <strong>anime TikTok</strong> “Oh No.” Every second, new trend is forming, and old ones are fading. It’s the cycle of life. If you’re seeking inspiration, read on: we’ve put up a guide to the finest TikTok trends of 2022. So how can we stay up with the current TikTok trends? How do we remain hip? A TikTok trend might be music, hashtag, dance, or challenge. Even how you modify your <strong>TikTok anime</strong> might become a trend like a fancy transition style. Once a <strong>TikTok anime</strong> trend begins to gather hold, people “hop on” it by duplicating a current TikTok video or theme.</p><h2 id="Top-20-TikTok-Anime-Idea"><a href="#Top-20-TikTok-Anime-Idea" class="headerlink" title="Top 20 TikTok Anime Idea"></a>Top 20 TikTok Anime Idea</h2><p>Brace yourself for the upcoming listicle. It contains all about TikTok Anime ideas; dances, songs, memes, and filters. Let’s find out one-by-one:</p><h3 id="Let’s-Groove"><a href="#Let’s-Groove" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Groove:"></a>Let’s Groove:</h3><p>This is another one of those TikTok trends where individuals show off their talents by dancing to trendy songs or music, which in this instance is a song called “Lets Groove” by an American band named “Earth Wind &amp; Fire“. This trend began when TikToker @absolutesnacc used a remix of Lets Groove to build a fan edit montage incorporating footage of actor Jason Segel from the TV program named “Freaks and Geeks”.</p><h3 id="Trending-dances"><a href="#Trending-dances" class="headerlink" title="Trending dances:"></a>Trending dances:</h3><p>TikTok is recognized for artists who know their movements — and in reality, many of the highest-earning TikTokers are dancers. But due to trendy dances, you don’t have to be an expert to perform the correct choreography. TikTok dances are generally short, pleasant, and entry-level, so amateurs may learn them with minimal effort. This offers a lot of flexibility for putting your twist on it—for example, ripping up the floor in a giant teddy bear costume.</p><h3 id="Prada-Bucket-challenge"><a href="#Prada-Bucket-challenge" class="headerlink" title="Prada Bucket challenge:"></a>Prada Bucket challenge:</h3><p>This TikTok fad is particular to the richer portion of the community, as artists join in this challenge to flaunt their costly attire when sporting a 600$ Prada Bucket hat, thus the name “Prada Bucket challenge”. Participants start by pretending to be “upset” about something, so they put their Prada Bucket hats on, and with some film editing magic, their clothing converts into more costly clothes.</p><h3 id="Glow-ups"><a href="#Glow-ups" class="headerlink" title="Glow-ups:"></a>Glow-ups:</h3><p>At its essence, a glow-up on TikTok is a “before” and “after.” Many artists may submit a few photographs or films depicting themselves as an awkward adolescent, then a last, contemporary clip. Glow-ups also work excellent for encouraging positive interaction. (Usually, one when they appear confident and amazing). These sorts of TikToks are wonderful for the wait-for-it factor: consumers are more willing to watch the complete video to see the finished product.</p><h3 id="Anime-Edits"><a href="#Anime-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Anime Edits:"></a>Anime Edits:</h3><p>If you’re an anime geek you’ve probably already heard about this trend when producers build a montage utilizing clips from their favorite anime series and add some background music simply to liven things up. Although this trend has been going on for a long now, it still doesn’t seem old since the anime fans have been keeping it alive. So, it doesn’t matter whether you enjoy Initial D or Naruto, this trend is relevant to all anime viewers.</p><h3 id="Edgy-humor"><a href="#Edgy-humor" class="headerlink" title="Edgy humor:"></a>Edgy humor:</h3><p>There’s a reason why TikTok is so popular with the under-30 crowd: the brief videos and highly scrollable characteristics of the app make it excellent for comedy, snark, and sass. And although many content producers and skilled social media marketers have discovered ways to convert TikTok into a business, the platform’s core aim is to “inspire creativity and generate joy.” So don’t take it too seriously. The edgier, the better.</p><h3 id="Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family"><a href="#Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family" class="headerlink" title="Making TikToks with Your Family:"></a>Making TikToks with Your Family:</h3><p>This goes hand in hand with being vulnerable and genuine—there’s nothing quite like a nice cameo from Mom, Dad, Grandma, or Grandpa. Because so many TikTok producers are millennials or Gen Z, it’s refreshing (and enjoyable) to see older folks on the platform. The difficult part of this is encouraging your family to join, but if you’ve got one excellent sport, you’ve hit gold. For example, simply try to watch this family dancing blooper without your heartbreak.</p><h3 id="Baked-Feta-Pasta"><a href="#Baked-Feta-Pasta" class="headerlink" title="Baked Feta Pasta:"></a>Baked Feta Pasta:</h3><p>This is a TikTok trend for all those foodies out there who enjoy delicious spaghetti with some cheese. This practice grew so prevalent that the grocery shops in Finland faced a scarcity of feta cheese. The technique of creating this pasta is straightforward, start by adding some cherry tomatoes and garlic in an oven-safe dish, sprinkle some salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, and pour some olive oil before combining the ingredients. Place a block of Feta cheese in the middle and bake in the oven until soft, compress the contents to make a paste, and combine with your favorite Pasta, that’s it! Your Baked Feta Pasta is ready to be served.</p><h3 id="Seamless-Transitions"><a href="#Seamless-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Seamless Transitions:"></a>Seamless Transitions:</h3><p>Another aspect that’s unique to TikTok is the transitions inside movies. The in-app editing tools make it simple to flip from one clip to another in a manner that appears like magic. This might be as basic as keeping your illumination the same and maintaining your camera in the same location. They may also be more sophisticated. Think spinning your camera about, putting your phone on the ground, zooming in and out – honestly, the sky’s the limit. When someone truly nails a transition, it’s virtually hard to view the video just once.</p><h3 id="Pet-Painting"><a href="#Pet-Painting" class="headerlink" title="Pet Painting:"></a>Pet Painting:</h3><p>This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to have your fuzzy companion included in one of your videos. No, you don’t paint a portrait of your pet, your pet performs the painting portion, how you may ask? it’s fairly easy, all you need is a canvas, some liquid colors of your choosing, a huge plastic bag, and a pet, of course, you will also need a paste-like food that your pet enjoys, peanut butter for instance. Start by covering the canvas with the plastic bag and spread peanut butter on the section covering the canvas, gently remove the canvas from the bag and keep the plastic aside.</p><h3 id="Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture"><a href="#Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Referencing Modern Pop Culture:"></a>Referencing Modern Pop Culture:</h3><p>Score some likes, comments, and shares by tapping into an already-huge fan following. Trending TV series and movies frequently inspire their TikTok trends. When Squid Game dominated the globe in 2021, it prompted suspense-making instructions, musical mashups, and many tracksuits. This is just one of the millions of instances of how inventive TikTok fans addressed the program.</p><h3 id="Satisfying-Videos"><a href="#Satisfying-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Satisfying Videos:"></a>Satisfying Videos:</h3><p>This simply possibly be the most widely accepted and least contentious genre ever: the enjoyable video. Like the day-in-the-life films, they are a celebration of the commonplace. So, the likelihood is, you’re already doing something pleasurable to watch. Whether its soap cutting or cake frosting or freezing bubbles, there’s something very relaxing and fulfilling about this type of material.</p><h3 id="Passing-the-Phone"><a href="#Passing-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Passing the Phone:"></a>Passing the Phone:</h3><p>We’re going to top things off with another TikTok trend, this one is a fun way of roasting your friends or family members and, of course, getting them involved in your TikToks. The way these trend works is really simple, you just call out your friend by making funny comments about certain bad habits or characteristics they have and then pass the phone to them because it’s their turn to do the same, so it’s just a series of taking turns roasting your friends and the best part is that there is no limit to how many people can participate.</p><h3 id="Challenge-Freezing-Honey"><a href="#Challenge-Freezing-Honey" class="headerlink" title="Challenge: Freezing Honey"></a>Challenge: Freezing Honey</h3><p>Another TikTok food craze is gaining traction, and it’s safe to assume that Honey is involved. One of the easiest fads to adopt is the freezing honey TikTok craze; everyone has honey and, of course, a freezer. This challenge calls for 100 percent pure honey, since non-pure honey may crystallize at low temperatures. If your honey comes in a plastic bottle, chuck it in the freezer; if it comes in a jar, pour it into a plastic container and remove any lids or bottle tops before freezing, since these may be difficult to remove after freezing.</p><h3 id="Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life"><a href="#Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life" class="headerlink" title="Documenting a Day in The Life:"></a>Documenting a Day in The Life:</h3><p>While grumpy Instagram users may tell you that “no one wants to see your avocado toast,” the truth is that a lot of people do. Many of these films romanticize the mundane, but humor has a place in this medium as well. If you’re a creative who gets a lot of questions in the comments section, here is the place to be. Seeing someone’s daily routine, whether it’s a second-grade teacher, a lawyer, or a couple living in a van, is a rewarding experience. Over 2 million people have liked this “actual day in the life of a vehicle.”</p><h3 id="Classical-Challenges"><a href="#Classical-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Classical Challenges:"></a>Classical Challenges:</h3><p>TikTok thrives on obstacles. For challenges, many TikTok users would all post films aiming to achieve the same thing, like the stair-step challenge, where they would dance up a set of steps in intricate ways. These are generally community-created trends; however, they may take the shape of sponsored hashtags, too. Challenges are a simple way for users on TikTok to feel like they’re part of the community.</p><h3 id="Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me"><a href="#Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me" class="headerlink" title="Tell Me Without Telling Me:"></a>Tell Me Without Telling Me:</h3><p>The creator begins by saying, “Tell me you drive a fast car without telling me you drive a fast car” and then says, “I’ll go first” to start a streak for other users to follow. Users then proceed to show the engine layout of their vehicle, the exhaust note, or possibly a flyby, so following this trend is a good way to make your TikToks stand out. This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to tell your audience what you’re trying to say or to depict certain occurrences subtly.</p><h3 id="Behind-the-scenes-Videos"><a href="#Behind-the-scenes-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Behind-the-scenes Videos:"></a>Behind-the-scenes Videos:</h3><p>We love an inside scoop, and behind-the-scenes films are perfect for teaching and for making viewers feel like they’re receiving something special. If you’re a creative who generates something tangible (like art, cuisine, or fashion) and advertises it on TikTok, a behind-the-scenes film might give your brand an added depth. You can even produce a behind-the-scenes TikTok describing how you made a TikTok. Ontario, California-based Logan’s candies attracted five and a half million followers by releasing TikToks depicting how their sweets were made—it’s a very interesting process.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123481/16836" target="_top" id="2123481">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123481" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123481/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Love-Nwantiti-Dance"><a href="#Love-Nwantiti-Dance" class="headerlink" title="Love Nwantiti Dance:"></a>Love Nwantiti Dance:</h3><p>The Love Nwantiti Dance is a dance that is performed by people who love one another. If you like dancing and music, you may try filming a TikTok dance video to capitalize on this trend. Love Nwantiti is a song by CKay, a Nigerian singer and songwriter who goes by the alias “CKay.” The phrase “Nwantiti” means “little love” in Igbo. This is one of those TikTok trends where content producers flash their skills by dancing to hot music or songs, in this instance a tune named “Love Nwantiti.” It is more popular with young people.</p><h3 id="Hashtags-with-Challenges"><a href="#Hashtags-with-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Hashtags with Challenges:"></a>Hashtags with Challenges:</h3><p>Many videos will frequently add a #ForYou hashtag to be featured on the page. Just like any other app, getting to the main page is key to landing a popular TikTok video and collecting new followers. Considering TikTok is starting to look at advertising directly in the app, revenue for TikTokers isn’t far off, and leveraging hashtags to trick the system is important to gaining viewers. TikTok virtually runs on hashtags. It’s what makes the app so entertaining. Everything is shared, and everyone is encouraged to join in. Clicking on hashtags, particularly ones that are developed around challenges, is a simple method to find what others are using to get to the ‘For You’ area.</p><h3 id="Learn-on-TikTok"><a href="#Learn-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Learn on TikTok:"></a>Learn on TikTok:</h3><p>This TikTok trend is a spectacular method for creators to share their ideas, talents, and life hacks and a chance for viewers to expand their knowledge on particular subjects and discover new items that may aid them in their day-to-day lives. The greatest part is that this trend is for everyone since the number of concepts that may be inferred here is practically never-ending, there might be someone excellent at cooking, someone, whose fighting abilities are good, someone who’s strong at arithmetic, or maybe someone who’s good at mending automobiles.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>From ramping up your posting schedule to taking part in challenges, and optimizing your hashtags, the inventive methods to get followers and develop a TikTok community are numerous. Regardless, if you find <strong>anime TikTok</strong> cringeworthy and strange, that’s probably because you grew up in the period before the social web. Generation Z’s enjoy the funny internet sharing platform and many now earn money from it. It’s easy, hilarious, and irreverent - and a pleasant change of pace from more serious networks such as Twitter and Facebook. It’s the perfect procrastination app that can lure you in for hours. Ultimately, the greatest strategy to expand your following will come down to your ingenuity, so don’t hold back and start experimenting with the <strong>TikTok anime</strong> videos you’ve always wanted to do.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-triumph-over-tiktoks-unseen-ban-barriers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Triumph Over TikTok's Unseen Ban Barriers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-20-viral-tiktok-anime-ideas/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, 20 Viral Tiktok Anime Ideas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-jest-engineer-online/"><u>[Updated] Jest Engineer Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-the-desktop-tiktok-creators-handbook-2023-edition-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Desktop TikTok Creator's Handbook 2023 Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-practices-for-free-clipart-use-in-projects/"><u>2024 Approved Best Practices for Free Clipart Use in Projects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/examining-the-limitations-of-immersive-tech/"><u>Examining the Limitations of Immersive Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-transfer-music-from-vivo-y78-5g-to-other-android-devices-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Ways to Transfer Music from Vivo Y78 5G to Other Android Devices Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-dance-routines-to-follow-with-these-20-country-songs-tiktok/"><u>In 2024, Easy Dance Routines to Follow with These 20 Country Songs (TikTok)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-premiere-pros-best-practices-free-template-samples/"><u>In 2024, Premiere Pro's Best Practices FREE Template Samples</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/master-the-pre-upload-process-on-tiktoks-copyright-policy-for-2024/"><u>Master the Pre-Upload Process on TikTok's Copyright Policy for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/poll-power-players-quintessential-politic-games-for-2024/"><u>Poll Power Players Quintessential Politic Games for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Powering the graphics is an Nvidia RTX 4070 Super with 12GB of GDDR6X VRAM, an Intel Core i7-14700F processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage for your OS and games library.</p><hr><p><a class="link"   href="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j9Ar8EpieBwBskeZ5TYvBm-200-100.png"  title="Alienware Aurora R16 Desktop (RTX 4070 Super) Gaming PC: now $1,599 at Dell">Alienware Aurora R16 Desktop (RTX 4070 Super) Gaming PC: now $1,599 at Dell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8900246-12578053?sid=tomshardware-us-1422250963949729982&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/desktop-computers/alienware-aurora-r16-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r16-desktop/useahctor16i17" >https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&amp;publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-8900246-12578053%3Fsid%3Dtomshardware-us-1422250963949729982%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdesktop-computers%2Falienware-aurora-r16-gaming-desktop%2Fspd%2Falienware-aurora-r16-desktop%2Fuseahctor16i17 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> <strong>Alienware Aurora R16 Desktop (RTX 4070 Super) Gaming PC:</strong> <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8900246-12578053?sid=tomshardware-us-4105539912223162879&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/desktop-computers/alienware-aurora-r16-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r16-desktop/useahctor16i17"><strong>now $1,599 at Dell</strong></a> (was $1,899)  </p><p> This configuration of the Alienware Aurora R16 uses an Nvidia RTX 4070 Super GPU, Intel Core i7-14700F processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage for your OS and games library.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Experience-Unmatched-Performance-Cybertruck-Inspired-Mini-PC-Comes-With-AMD-Ryzen-7-and-Up-To-64GB-RAM-No-Bug-Cleaning-Needed"><a href="#Experience-Unmatched-Performance-Cybertruck-Inspired-Mini-PC-Comes-With-AMD-Ryzen-7-and-Up-To-64GB-RAM-No-Bug-Cleaning-Needed" class="headerlink" title="Experience Unmatched Performance: Cybertruck-Inspired Mini PC Comes With AMD Ryzen 7 and Up To 64GB RAM - No Bug Cleaning Needed"></a>Experience Unmatched Performance: Cybertruck-Inspired Mini PC Comes With AMD Ryzen 7 and Up To 64GB RAM - No Bug Cleaning Needed</h2><p>The Xyber Team launched its Xyber XPC Mini Desktop Computer campaign on<a class="link"   href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/xyber-xpc-world-s-fastest-ryzen-7-mini-pc-truck/coming%5Fsoon" >Indiegogo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This mini-PC houses a Ryzen 7 8845HS processor with up to 64 GB of RAM and a 1 TB M.2 NVMe 2280 SSD in the body of a Tesla Cybertruck. The company is likely not calling it that name due to copyright infringement, but its mini-PC is an almost faithful representation of the real thing.</p><p> The Cybertruck mini-PC creatively hides its ports in the rear bumper, where you get a DC-in jack for power, a USA 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A port, a single HDMI 2.1 port, two USB 3.1 Gen Type-C ports with PD3.0, and a 3.5 mm combo jack. The SSD slot is also easily accessible from the underbody of the mini-PC, but you need to do a complete teardown if you want to upgrade your RAM.</p><p> But aside from the electronics inside the Xyber XPC, you also get a lot in the form of the Cybertruck body that sits on top of the frame that holds the motherboard. It appears to be made from a cast magnesium frame, giving it a solid feel. The doors and the tailgate on the Cybertruck also open, with the latter featuring a built-in ramp. It’s unfortunate, though, that it doesn’t have the retractable tonneau cover.</p><p> Image 1 of 3</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Xyber Team XPC internals"                ></p><p> Xyber Team XPC internals  (Image credit: Taki Udon &#x2F; YouTube)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Xyber Team XPC ports"                ></p><p> Xyber Team XPC ports  (Image credit: Taki Udon &#x2F; YouTube)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Xyber Team XPC front"                ></p><p> Xyber Team XPC front  (Image credit: Taki Udon &#x2F; YouTube)</p><p> The plastic frame that holds the motherboard is also well-crafted and detailed, including the seats, plastic wheels, and rubber tires. A daughter board inside the frunk of this funky little mini-PC Cybertruck controls the front and rear lights, and you can steer the truck’s front wheel, albeit by pushing the wheels left or right with your fingers.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> We noticed that the Xyber XPC Mini Desktop Computer has a USB Type-A port under the front of the truck. We don’t know what it is for, but it would be funny if you could repurpose it to power the truck if you add a battery, like how the Apple Magic Mouse still recharges today. The mini-PC Cybertruck also has an allocation for built-in speakers, but the sample we saw doesn’t have one.</p><p> This Stealth Cybertruck PC Can Game - YouTube <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/1DJs6fIS4Pg/maxresdefault.jpg"                      alt="This Stealth Cybertruck PC Can Game - YouTube"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/1DJs6fIS4Pg" >Watch On <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Although the Xyber XPC has many vents for cooling, it still hits 100 degrees C with the fans going full tilt when set to its maximum 60-watt TDP. But with the TDP lowered to 30 watts, the CPU’s peak temperature is now just 60 degrees Celsius, and the fans are barely audible.</p><p> We don’t have pricing information yet about the Xyber XPC, though, as it’s still in the campaign pre-launch stage. But the team behind the mini-PC Cybertruck says that they’re optimizing the BIOS and OS to get the best performance out of this small desktop computer.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> We’d love to get on this mini-PC Cybertruck and run it at its pace.

For your reference, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-zen-3-ryzen-5000-release-date-specifications-pricing-benchmarks-all-we-know" >Zen 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> architecture was released in late 2020, and we’re currently awaiting the release of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-shares-new-cpu-core-roadmap-3nm-zen-5-by-2024-4th-gen-infinity-architecture" >Zen 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here in 2024.</p><p> So, for the most part, the Ayaneo AM01 is still pretty much the same classic Macintosh-inspired mini-PC we covered before and has a very similar pricing scheme with the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-5800u-cezanne-zen-3-apu-geekbench-benchmark" >Ryzen 7 5800U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it does with other units. As-is, the Zen 3 Ryzen 7 5800U model looks astonishingly identical to the Zen 2 Ryzen 7 5700U at a glance, with the same basic core&#x2F;thread spec, though, of course, the newer architecture has much better performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zkexFiVS4JdrAYoKakvYu5-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Current pricing matrix for the Zen 3-based Ryzen 7 5800U configuration of Ayaneo AM01."                ></p><p> Current pricing matrix for the Zen 3-based Ryzen 7 5800U configuration of Ayaneo AM01.  (Image credit: Ayaneo)</p><p> The Ayaneo blog post also confirms that the Ryzen 7 is slated to operate at up to 35 Watts on the AM01, an ample boost to the official maximum TDP of 25 Watts. This higher TDP enabled alongside the proper<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ram,4057.html" >RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> selection should help maximize the performance of the iGPU within.</p><p> Pricing-wise, the Ayaneo AM01 is best purchased during the Early Bird window, which is a solid $30 cheaper. Considering the specs and size of the device, the price point is pretty tolerable for what it is, though the best bang for your buck will be found in devices like the LCD<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/steam-deck-valve-gaming-handheld" >Steam Deck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , used PCs, etc.</p><p> If you hope to get your hands on the Ayaneo AM01 PC as soon as possible, head to their Indiegogo page to buy the device through crowdfunding. And as always, while we acknowledge Ayaneo’s excellent track record in crowdfunded devices, you can’t know what to expect until people get their hands on it.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp;

Know that whatever you set cannot be modified for almost 30 days. So when picking a name, here are a few tips:</p><h3 id="1-Describe-your-identity"><a href="#1-Describe-your-identity" class="headerlink" title="1. Describe your identity"></a>1. Describe your identity</h3><p>Describe to your followers what you do.

It is one of the valuable factors you shouldn’t violate while picking your name. You can save your characters and use them intelligently to showcase your audience or identity thoroughly.

It is also claimed to be the “first Intel Ultra 9 AI Mini PC with a 4-inch Touchscreen.” With the rising popularity of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cooling/hands-on-lian-lis-lcd-screen-fans-turn-heads-and-are-surprisingly-affordable-but-not-as-configurable-as-id-like" >extra screens in PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , integrating one into a compact desktop might be a popular idea.</p><p> Starting from the outside, we see that the AtomMan X7 Ti would be a conventional-looking<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/asus-gets-license-to-make-intel-nucs" >NUC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -alike apart from two things. Firstly, it features a 4-inch 480p touch display which covers a fair portion of the top panel. Secondly, it comes with a neat stand that angles the display panel into an easy glanceable view. Furthermore, Minisforum has followed some logic by situating a 1080p<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-hello-fido2-certification-may-update-microsoft,39261.html" >Windows Hello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> compatible webcam and dual mics above the touchscreen, appealing to video conferencing fans.</p><p> While we are considering external features, let’s look at the ports. Despite its compact size (145 x 145 x 49mm), the AtomMan X7 Ti features a decent quantity and selection of ports, as follows: RJ45 5G Ethernet Port ×2, DP 2.0, HDMI 2.1,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/worlds-first-oculink-usb-4-egpu-with-radeor-rx-7600m-xt" >OCulink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Port (up to 64Gbps), USB4 ×2, USB3.2 Gen2 Type-A ×2, USB3.2 Gen1 Type-A, USB2.0, a 3.5mm Combo Jack, SD Card slot, and a Power Button with an embedded fingerprint reader. <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wi-fi-7-faq" >Wi-Fi 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Bluetooth 5.4 complement the dual Ethernet ports. It must also be noted that the mix of dedicated monitor and USB4 ports means you can connect up to four external displays to this machine.</p><p> Image 1 of 3</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> Moving inside, the star of the show is the new Intel Core Ultra 9 processor<a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/236849/intel-core-ultra-9-processor-185h-24m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/specifications.html" >185H <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a 16C&#x2F;22T CPU running at up to 5.1 GHz, and onboard Arc GPU with eight Xe cores running at up to 2.35 GHz.

It uses standard DDR5-5600 SO-DIMMs, up to a max of 64GB. There are also two M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 SSD slots, and the aforementioned wireless functionality comes courtesy of a socketed Intel BE200 card, so it can be changed for repair or upgrade.</p><p> We don’t have pricing for the AtomMan X7 Ti.

It’s the cycle of life. If you’re seeking inspiration, read on: we’ve put up a guide to the finest TikTok trends of 2022. So how can we stay up with the current TikTok trends? How do we remain hip? A TikTok trend might be music, hashtag, dance, or challenge. Even how you modify your <strong>TikTok anime</strong> might become a trend like a fancy transition style. Once a <strong>TikTok anime</strong> trend begins to gather hold, people “hop on” it by duplicating a current TikTok video or theme.</p><h2 id="Top-20-TikTok-Anime-Idea"><a href="#Top-20-TikTok-Anime-Idea" class="headerlink" title="Top 20 TikTok Anime Idea"></a>Top 20 TikTok Anime Idea</h2><p>Brace yourself for the upcoming listicle. It contains all about TikTok Anime ideas; dances, songs, memes, and filters. Let’s find out one-by-one:</p><h3 id="Let’s-Groove"><a href="#Let’s-Groove" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Groove:"></a>Let’s Groove:</h3><p>This is another one of those TikTok trends where individuals show off their talents by dancing to trendy songs or music, which in this instance is a song called “Lets Groove” by an American band named “Earth Wind &amp; Fire“. This trend began when TikToker @absolutesnacc used a remix of Lets Groove to build a fan edit montage incorporating footage of actor Jason Segel from the TV program named “Freaks and Geeks”.</p><h3 id="Trending-dances"><a href="#Trending-dances" class="headerlink" title="Trending dances:"></a>Trending dances:</h3><p>TikTok is recognized for artists who know their movements — and in reality, many of the highest-earning TikTokers are dancers. But due to trendy dances, you don’t have to be an expert to perform the correct choreography. TikTok dances are generally short, pleasant, and entry-level, so amateurs may learn them with minimal effort. This offers a lot of flexibility for putting your twist on it—for example, ripping up the floor in a giant teddy bear costume.</p><h3 id="Prada-Bucket-challenge"><a href="#Prada-Bucket-challenge" class="headerlink" title="Prada Bucket challenge:"></a>Prada Bucket challenge:</h3><p>This TikTok fad is particular to the richer portion of the community, as artists join in this challenge to flaunt their costly attire when sporting a 600$ Prada Bucket hat, thus the name “Prada Bucket challenge”. Participants start by pretending to be “upset” about something, so they put their Prada Bucket hats on, and with some film editing magic, their clothing converts into more costly clothes.</p><h3 id="Glow-ups"><a href="#Glow-ups" class="headerlink" title="Glow-ups:"></a>Glow-ups:</h3><p>At its essence, a glow-up on TikTok is a “before” and “after.” Many artists may submit a few photographs or films depicting themselves as an awkward adolescent, then a last, contemporary clip. Glow-ups also work excellent for encouraging positive interaction. (Usually, one when they appear confident and amazing). These sorts of TikToks are wonderful for the wait-for-it factor: consumers are more willing to watch the complete video to see the finished product.</p><h3 id="Anime-Edits"><a href="#Anime-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Anime Edits:"></a>Anime Edits:</h3><p>If you’re an anime geek you’ve probably already heard about this trend when producers build a montage utilizing clips from their favorite anime series and add some background music simply to liven things up. Although this trend has been going on for a long now, it still doesn’t seem old since the anime fans have been keeping it alive. So, it doesn’t matter whether you enjoy Initial D or Naruto, this trend is relevant to all anime viewers.</p><h3 id="Edgy-humor"><a href="#Edgy-humor" class="headerlink" title="Edgy humor:"></a>Edgy humor:</h3><p>There’s a reason why TikTok is so popular with the under-30 crowd: the brief videos and highly scrollable characteristics of the app make it excellent for comedy, snark, and sass. And although many content producers and skilled social media marketers have discovered ways to convert TikTok into a business, the platform’s core aim is to “inspire creativity and generate joy.” So don’t take it too seriously. The edgier, the better.</p><h3 id="Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family"><a href="#Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family" class="headerlink" title="Making TikToks with Your Family:"></a>Making TikToks with Your Family:</h3><p>This goes hand in hand with being vulnerable and genuine—there’s nothing quite like a nice cameo from Mom, Dad, Grandma, or Grandpa. Because so many TikTok producers are millennials or Gen Z, it’s refreshing (and enjoyable) to see older folks on the platform. The difficult part of this is encouraging your family to join, but if you’ve got one excellent sport, you’ve hit gold. For example, simply try to watch this family dancing blooper without your heartbreak.</p><h3 id="Baked-Feta-Pasta"><a href="#Baked-Feta-Pasta" class="headerlink" title="Baked Feta Pasta:"></a>Baked Feta Pasta:</h3><p>This is a TikTok trend for all those foodies out there who enjoy delicious spaghetti with some cheese. This practice grew so prevalent that the grocery shops in Finland faced a scarcity of feta cheese. The technique of creating this pasta is straightforward, start by adding some cherry tomatoes and garlic in an oven-safe dish, sprinkle some salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, and pour some olive oil before combining the ingredients. Place a block of Feta cheese in the middle and bake in the oven until soft, compress the contents to make a paste, and combine with your favorite Pasta, that’s it! Your Baked Feta Pasta is ready to be served.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123476/16836" target="_top" id="2123476">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123476" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123476/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Seamless-Transitions"><a href="#Seamless-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Seamless Transitions:"></a>Seamless Transitions:</h3><p>Another aspect that’s unique to TikTok is the transitions inside movies. The in-app editing tools make it simple to flip from one clip to another in a manner that appears like magic. This might be as basic as keeping your illumination the same and maintaining your camera in the same location. They may also be more sophisticated. Think spinning your camera about, putting your phone on the ground, zooming in and out – honestly, the sky’s the limit. When someone truly nails a transition, it’s virtually hard to view the video just once.</p><h3 id="Pet-Painting"><a href="#Pet-Painting" class="headerlink" title="Pet Painting:"></a>Pet Painting:</h3><p>This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to have your fuzzy companion included in one of your videos. No, you don’t paint a portrait of your pet, your pet performs the painting portion, how you may ask? it’s fairly easy, all you need is a canvas, some liquid colors of your choosing, a huge plastic bag, and a pet, of course, you will also need a paste-like food that your pet enjoys, peanut butter for instance. Start by covering the canvas with the plastic bag and spread peanut butter on the section covering the canvas, gently remove the canvas from the bag and keep the plastic aside.</p><h3 id="Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture"><a href="#Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Referencing Modern Pop Culture:"></a>Referencing Modern Pop Culture:</h3><p>Score some likes, comments, and shares by tapping into an already-huge fan following. Trending TV series and movies frequently inspire their TikTok trends. When Squid Game dominated the globe in 2021, it prompted suspense-making instructions, musical mashups, and many tracksuits. This is just one of the millions of instances of how inventive TikTok fans addressed the program.</p><h3 id="Satisfying-Videos"><a href="#Satisfying-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Satisfying Videos:"></a>Satisfying Videos:</h3><p>This simply possibly be the most widely accepted and least contentious genre ever: the enjoyable video. Like the day-in-the-life films, they are a celebration of the commonplace. So, the likelihood is, you’re already doing something pleasurable to watch. Whether its soap cutting or cake frosting or freezing bubbles, there’s something very relaxing and fulfilling about this type of material.</p><h3 id="Passing-the-Phone"><a href="#Passing-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Passing the Phone:"></a>Passing the Phone:</h3><p>We’re going to top things off with another TikTok trend, this one is a fun way of roasting your friends or family members and, of course, getting them involved in your TikToks. The way these trend works is really simple, you just call out your friend by making funny comments about certain bad habits or characteristics they have and then pass the phone to them because it’s their turn to do the same, so it’s just a series of taking turns roasting your friends and the best part is that there is no limit to how many people can participate.</p><h3 id="Challenge-Freezing-Honey"><a href="#Challenge-Freezing-Honey" class="headerlink" title="Challenge: Freezing Honey"></a>Challenge: Freezing Honey</h3><p>Another TikTok food craze is gaining traction, and it’s safe to assume that Honey is involved. One of the easiest fads to adopt is the freezing honey TikTok craze; everyone has honey and, of course, a freezer. This challenge calls for 100 percent pure honey, since non-pure honey may crystallize at low temperatures. If your honey comes in a plastic bottle, chuck it in the freezer; if it comes in a jar, pour it into a plastic container and remove any lids or bottle tops before freezing, since these may be difficult to remove after freezing.</p><h3 id="Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life"><a href="#Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life" class="headerlink" title="Documenting a Day in The Life:"></a>Documenting a Day in The Life:</h3><p>While grumpy Instagram users may tell you that “no one wants to see your avocado toast,” the truth is that a lot of people do. Many of these films romanticize the mundane, but humor has a place in this medium as well. If you’re a creative who gets a lot of questions in the comments section, here is the place to be. Seeing someone’s daily routine, whether it’s a second-grade teacher, a lawyer, or a couple living in a van, is a rewarding experience. Over 2 million people have liked this “actual day in the life of a vehicle.”</p><h3 id="Classical-Challenges"><a href="#Classical-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Classical Challenges:"></a>Classical Challenges:</h3><p>TikTok thrives on obstacles. For challenges, many TikTok users would all post films aiming to achieve the same thing, like the stair-step challenge, where they would dance up a set of steps in intricate ways. These are generally community-created trends; however, they may take the shape of sponsored hashtags, too. Challenges are a simple way for users on TikTok to feel like they’re part of the community.</p><h3 id="Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me"><a href="#Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me" class="headerlink" title="Tell Me Without Telling Me:"></a>Tell Me Without Telling Me:</h3><p>The creator begins by saying, “Tell me you drive a fast car without telling me you drive a fast car” and then says, “I’ll go first” to start a streak for other users to follow. Users then proceed to show the engine layout of their vehicle, the exhaust note, or possibly a flyby, so following this trend is a good way to make your TikToks stand out. This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to tell your audience what you’re trying to say or to depict certain occurrences subtly.</p><h3 id="Behind-the-scenes-Videos"><a href="#Behind-the-scenes-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Behind-the-scenes Videos:"></a>Behind-the-scenes Videos:</h3><p>We love an inside scoop, and behind-the-scenes films are perfect for teaching and for making viewers feel like they’re receiving something special. If you’re a creative who generates something tangible (like art, cuisine, or fashion) and advertises it on TikTok, a behind-the-scenes film might give your brand an added depth. You can even produce a behind-the-scenes TikTok describing how you made a TikTok. Ontario, California-based Logan’s candies attracted five and a half million followers by releasing TikToks depicting how their sweets were made—it’s a very interesting process.</p><h3 id="Love-Nwantiti-Dance"><a href="#Love-Nwantiti-Dance" class="headerlink" title="Love Nwantiti Dance:"></a>Love Nwantiti Dance:</h3><p>The Love Nwantiti Dance is a dance that is performed by people who love one another. If you like dancing and music, you may try filming a TikTok dance video to capitalize on this trend. Love Nwantiti is a song by CKay, a Nigerian singer and songwriter who goes by the alias “CKay.” The phrase “Nwantiti” means “little love” in Igbo. This is one of those TikTok trends where content producers flash their skills by dancing to hot music or songs, in this instance a tune named “Love Nwantiti.” It is more popular with young people.</p><h3 id="Hashtags-with-Challenges"><a href="#Hashtags-with-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Hashtags with Challenges:"></a>Hashtags with Challenges:</h3><p>Many videos will frequently add a #ForYou hashtag to be featured on the page. Just like any other app, getting to the main page is key to landing a popular TikTok video and collecting new followers. Considering TikTok is starting to look at advertising directly in the app, revenue for TikTokers isn’t far off, and leveraging hashtags to trick the system is important to gaining viewers. TikTok virtually runs on hashtags. It’s what makes the app so entertaining. Everything is shared, and everyone is encouraged to join in. Clicking on hashtags, particularly ones that are developed around challenges, is a simple method to find what others are using to get to the ‘For You’ area.</p><h3 id="Learn-on-TikTok"><a href="#Learn-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Learn on TikTok:"></a>Learn on TikTok:</h3><p>This TikTok trend is a spectacular method for creators to share their ideas, talents, and life hacks and a chance for viewers to expand their knowledge on particular subjects and discover new items that may aid them in their day-to-day lives. The greatest part is that this trend is for everyone since the number of concepts that may be inferred here is practically never-ending, there might be someone excellent at cooking, someone, whose fighting abilities are good, someone who’s strong at arithmetic, or maybe someone who’s good at mending automobiles.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>From ramping up your posting schedule to taking part in challenges, and optimizing your hashtags, the inventive methods to get followers and develop a TikTok community are numerous. Regardless, if you find <strong>anime TikTok</strong> cringeworthy and strange, that’s probably because you grew up in the period before the social web. Generation Z’s enjoy the funny internet sharing platform and many now earn money from it. It’s easy, hilarious, and irreverent - and a pleasant change of pace from more serious networks such as Twitter and Facebook. It’s the perfect procrastination app that can lure you in for hours. Ultimately, the greatest strategy to expand your following will come down to your ingenuity, so don’t hold back and start experimenting with the <strong>TikTok anime</strong> videos you’ve always wanted to do.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-joke-jamboree-on-tiktok-the-best-hilarious-video-threads-for-a-laugh/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Joke Jamboree on TikTok The Best Hilarious Video Threads for a Laugh</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-pre-upload-tiktoks-copyright-guidelines/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Mastering Pre-Upload TikTok's Copyright Guidelines</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-chromeandroidios-users-guide-to-perfecting-tiktok-video-posts/"><u>[Updated] Chrome/Android/iOS Users' Guide to Perfecting TikTok Video Posts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-exploring-facebooks-newest-feature-evolution-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Exploring Facebook's Newest Feature Evolution for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://os-tips.techidaily.com/bent-iphone-beyond-repair-retrieve-your-valuable-data-instantly/"><u>Bent iPhone Beyond Repair?
