Sometimes when viewing or recording a video, an error does not allow the app to play the video. This issue is not directly connected to the app; however, we may solve this mistake by utilizing alternative ways such as network difficulties. Sometimes our network is giving trouble to the system, and it is not supporting the videos we wish to play. So, the first and foremost duty to remove this problem is to examine our connection. To solve the connection difficulties or ISP APN, we need to take the following steps:</p><ul><li><p>Open the settings and click on the network and internet option. From there, click on the mobile network &gt; Open ‘Advanced Options’</p></li><li><p>Click on the access point names and select the three full stops in the upper right corner of your phone’s screen.</p></li><li><p>Then click on reset to default.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Step-Up-Your-Game-Stunning-TikTok-Videos-Made-Simple"><a href="#Step-Up-Your-Game-Stunning-TikTok-Videos-Made-Simple" class="headerlink" title="Step Up Your Game: Stunning TikTok Videos Made Simple"></a>Step Up Your Game: Stunning TikTok Videos Made Simple</h2><p>TikTok is the video platform that shook the world during the pandemic. It capitalized on people’s shortened attention spans and focused on short-form videos to provide entertainment. Also, it provided people with an easy road to fame and with a solid side hustle.</p><p>Are you one of those who aspire to be TikTok’s future top-earner? Try making videos using <strong>TikTok video templates</strong>! They’ll allow you to churn out high-quality content faster than the competition. In this article, you will learn more about TikTok videos. Furthermore, we’ll introduce you to the 5 best places from where you can find great TikTok video templates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-video-template.gif"                      alt="use templates to create tiktok videos"                ></p><p>Get a Knowledge of TikTok Videos</p><p>TikTok videos are short-form content. They can be up to 3 minutes in length. And that is their charm. Busy people looking for “bite-sized” content turn to this platform for entertainment.</p><p>The TikTok videos that become successful include filters, effects, stickers, voiceovers, and background music. They can be about different topics, so anyone can make them.</p><p>An important thing creators should know is the dimension of videos. TikTok videos are made for mobile viewing (though you can watch them using the web app). So, videos are in portrait. That said, the recommended video size is 1080 x 1920 with a 9:16 aspect ratio.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-Templates-To-Make-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Why-Use-Templates-To-Make-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Templates To Make TikTok Videos?"></a>Why Use Templates To Make TikTok Videos?</h2><p>The competition on TikTok is tough.

The new<a class="link"   href="https://www.minisforum.com/page/x7ti/index.html?lang=en" >AtomMan X7 Ti <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> becomes the first in the firm’s AtomMan line, described as a high-end cutting-edge marque by Minisforum. It is also claimed to be the “first Intel Ultra 9 AI Mini PC with a 4-inch Touchscreen.” With the rising popularity of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cooling/hands-on-lian-lis-lcd-screen-fans-turn-heads-and-are-surprisingly-affordable-but-not-as-configurable-as-id-like" >extra screens in PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , integrating one into a compact desktop might be a popular idea.</p><p> Starting from the outside, we see that the AtomMan X7 Ti would be a conventional-looking<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/asus-gets-license-to-make-intel-nucs" >NUC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -alike apart from two things. Firstly, it features a 4-inch 480p touch display which covers a fair portion of the top panel. Secondly, it comes with a neat stand that angles the display panel into an easy glanceable view. Furthermore, Minisforum has followed some logic by situating a 1080p<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-hello-fido2-certification-may-update-microsoft,39261.html" >Windows Hello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> compatible webcam and dual mics above the touchscreen, appealing to video conferencing fans.</p><p> While we are considering external features, let’s look at the ports. Despite its compact size (145 x 145 x 49mm), the AtomMan X7 Ti features a decent quantity and selection of ports, as follows: RJ45 5G Ethernet Port ×2, DP 2.0, HDMI 2.1,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/worlds-first-oculink-usb-4-egpu-with-radeor-rx-7600m-xt" >OCulink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Port (up to 64Gbps), USB4 ×2, USB3.2 Gen2 Type-A ×2, USB3.2 Gen1 Type-A, USB2.0, a 3.5mm Combo Jack, SD Card slot, and a Power Button with an embedded fingerprint reader. <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wi-fi-7-faq" >Wi-Fi 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Bluetooth 5.4 complement the dual Ethernet ports. It must also be noted that the mix of dedicated monitor and USB4 ports means you can connect up to four external displays to this machine.</p><p> Image 1 of 3</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> Moving inside, the star of the show is the new Intel Core Ultra 9 processor<a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/236849/intel-core-ultra-9-processor-185h-24m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/specifications.html" >185H <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a 16C&#x2F;22T CPU running at up to 5.1 GHz, and onboard Arc GPU with eight Xe cores running at up to 2.35 GHz.

It uses standard DDR5-5600 SO-DIMMs, up to a max of 64GB. There are also two M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 SSD slots, and the aforementioned wireless functionality comes courtesy of a socketed Intel BE200 card, so it can be changed for repair or upgrade.</p><p> We don’t have pricing for the AtomMan X7 Ti.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition packs all the functionality of an Amazon Fire TV streaming device right into its chassis. This 55-inch LED smart TV combines affordability with Alexa, Amazon Prime content, and access to over 500,000 episodes across your favorite streaming platforms. We thoroughly tested the Toshiba’s picture quality, display settings, and the Fire OS interface and usability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pCLBMqSK1Hi3ePW2jzUkDycA2IU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_04-f1f62a55ea504fc9aa98fc9e14527ba7.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Best-for-a-bigger-room"><a href="#Design-Best-for-a-bigger-room" class="headerlink" title="Design: Best for a bigger room"></a><strong>Design: Best for a bigger room</strong></h2><p> The Toshiba 55-inch Fire TV is not a small device. While it only weighs 31.3 pounds with the stand (though the stand itself weighs less than a pound), it’s both tall and wide enough to make moving and installing it a two-person job. The TV’s dimensions with the stand are 27.8 inches tall, 44.6 inches wide, and 10.7 inches deep, and the screen size (on a diagonal) measures at 49.5 inches.</p><p> There’s no wall mount included in the box, but there are four standard VESA mounting holes on the back of the unit for safe and easy installation. In a smaller space, wall-mounting this television might not be a bad idea. Even in the relatively modestly-sized room where we tested the TV, it nearly completely took up the entire shelf where we placed it and a broad swath of the wall behind it. This TV is not particularly thin and actually tends to be a bit bulky in the very back of the unit, and the stand also adds width. The legs splay out and require a wide, long surface to accommodate them.</p><p> An attractive option for shoppers who want a smart 4K TV under $500.</p><p> The other important component is the Alexa-enabled remote, which is small, lightweight, and contains a circular dial with directional controls and play&#x2F;pause functionality. You also have the benefit of summoning Alexa with the touch of the speaker button, which is intuitively placed at the top of the remote (though we often accidentally hit it when we were trying to push the Home button, which is right below it).</p><p> The buttons are clearly laid out on the remote, and it’s convenient to have volume and mute controls in addition to a shortcut button to antenna channels. There are also some shortcut buttons as well: Prime Video, Nextflix, HBO, and Vue.</p><p> There are some downsides to the remote’s overall quality. Unlike other Fire TV remotes that create a completely smooth and seamless effect on the back, this remote is a lot more traditional, with a tab for pulling off the battery cover. It makes an unfortunate creaking noise almost every time you push a button, and while it never fell off the noise was distracting and contributed to the plastic and flimsy feel of the remote.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/bohXBE5CBPeYtI5seooxoQhyzkY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_02-781cfad0cacf41878e3ffb24afd56c6e.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Quick and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Quick and easy</strong></h2><p> There is a little setup required out of the box, whether you wall mount it or attach the stand. We chose the latter and found the instructions to be straightforward. Each leg requires both a longer 35 mm screw to help create a secure attachment to the bottom of the TV and two 10 mm screws that secure the legs to the back of the unit.</p><p> Installing the legs isn’t complicated, but it can be awkward because you need to place the TV screen-side down on a soft or cushioned surface. It helps to have a bit of space to do this either on a sofa or a clean, carpeted area, and maybe a helping hand to situate the TV wherever you plan to put it.</p><p> Once the legs were in place, we placed the TV on a table and plugged in the power cord. The TV powered on immediately and we were prompted to press the play&#x2F;pause button on the remote to begin setup.</p><p> We were guided through a quick process of connecting to Wi-Fi, signing in with Amazon account credentials, and registering the TV to our account. While you can enjoy this television without an existing Amazon account, you will have to create one in order to complete setup and gain access to all apps. The whole setup only takes a few moments, though, and we were on the Home screen of the Fire OS interface before we knew it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Gg5qCbaSxBZF2n4hLJ-UWMjX7vk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_05-ea81ea03abde49c3856c921f1321d024.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crisp-but-sometimes-needs-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crisp-but-sometimes-needs-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crisp but sometimes needs tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crisp but sometimes needs tweaking</strong></h2><p> While setting up the TV was very fast and took only a few minutes, we did have to spend some time adjusting the picture settings. Unfortunately, this is not something the online user manual provides much insight about.</p><p> We headed straight for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> content on Amazon Prime and played a number of movies and TV series. What we found was that it consistently took about a minute for the picture to kick into Ultra HD<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The default standard picture settings yielded an incredibly dark picture with too much contrast. The reds were very exaggerated and the low-light scenes, especially scenes at night, were very difficult to see.</p><p> Accessing the HDR picture settings is not exactly intuitive. Long-pressing the Home button on the remote brings up a shortcut menu and that’s where we were able to access HDR picture settings. Picture settings can be found under Display and Sounds in the main Settings menu, but there’s only a blanket setting for all app and video content. Settings that work for regular HD content, which was the majority of the content we viewed, were inadequate for HDR content.</p><p>Ultra HD HDR content shines in a realistic and rich way.</p><p> For the best Ultra HD HDR picture quality, we found that changing to movie mode instead of standard smoothed out the saturation a bit. For good measure we also turned off Dynamic Backlight, HDR Tone Mapping, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mpeg-file-2622031" >MPEG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Noise Reduction. This helped the Ultra HD HDR content shine in a realistic and rich way.</p><p> Another image quality issue we encountered was<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macroblocking-and-pixelation-1847333" >video artifacts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which are glitches and distortions in picture quality. This can be a result of data loss due to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-media-file-compression-1847431" >media file compression <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , signal interference, or other factors. It was a particular problem when viewing HD Amazon Prime content, but we also observed it in Hulu content. Turning off Edge Enhancer and Motion Processing from the picture settings menu helped eliminate artifacting when streaming media, but it didn’t resolve this issue when we watched live TV via Hulu. There we got long sequences of pixelated content and macroblocking, where the image appeared broken up into blocky chunks.</p><p> We did switch the picture mode to Game when playing an HD game, but didn’t notice a significant difference in quality. The picture was already quite vibrant and clear without making this switch, and the only discernible difference was that Game mode made color tones a bit more saturated. Presumably the panel is deactivating some post-processing to improve input lag, but we didn’t notice a significant difference in either quality or latency.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KHIDIBlAKmxc6ZGa6AocjOoGEpY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_06-1fe0d195f3844b89822833f4c0f4d69e.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151882/7443" target="_top" id="2151882">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151882" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151882/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Well-rounded-and-clear"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Well-rounded-and-clear" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Well-rounded and clear"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Well-rounded and clear</strong></h2><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 is outfitted with two 10-watt speakers enhanced with DTS Studio Sound. According to DTS, this technology smooths transitions, volume, and bass levels while changing channels or sources.</p><p> Audio quality isn’t spectacular but is generally consistent and clear across media. The volume can get quite loud and fill the room, which is good if you don’t plan to add additional home-entertainment speakers. There are also bass, treble, and balancing settings that help cater to your individual EQ preferences.</p><p> Like the suite of picture settings, there are sound modes to achieve the most appropriate audio experience based on what media you’re consuming. These modes include Standard, Movie, Music, Clear Voice, and a user-defined Custom mode. Movie mode seemed to work out best for our preferences, yielding neither an extremely tinny nor bassy sound.</p><p> There are also the DTS TruSurround and TruVolume controls—TruSurround is on by default and functions to create a richer and more amplified sound, but TruVolume is off. Flipping it on helped control and even out fluctuations in sound, which was a problem we encountered streaming some content on Netflix and Hulu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FdoBEgX__hYz6EgBVAeh47z5pyg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_03-39faf55a89c8450cbddcb795f2f0fcc8.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896505/19272" target="_top" id="1896505">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896505" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896505/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Software-Easy-to-use-but-cluttered"><a href="#Software-Easy-to-use-but-cluttered" class="headerlink" title="Software: Easy to use but cluttered"></a><strong>Software: Easy to use but cluttered</strong></h2><p> This Toshiba TV runs on Fire OS, which is easy to interact with but has some quirks. As an Amazon product it feature Amazon Prime content first and foremost, which may be convenient for Prime subscribers but is slightly less so if you’re primarily looking for Netflix or Hulu content. We found that the remote occasionally lagged if we didn’t point it directly toward the TV sensors, and virtually any time we loaded and exited apps or spun up Prime content. Loading time varied from a few seconds to upwards of ten. There’s also an odd bug when exiting out of the Hulu app. It routinely took about five seconds before the system got us back to the Home dashboard, before which it would take us to the Hulu home page.</p><p> The Fire OS Home menu is the spot that features recent apps, downloaded apps, as well as suggested content based on viewing activity. This arrangement is clear enough, but wading through options becomes more confusing based on the other menu pages, which include Movies, Live, TV Shows, Apps, and Your Videos. Much of the content you’ll see across these pages is duplicated, so overlap is a part of the user experience, which means clutter and confusion. Once you get a handle on this arrangement it’s easy enough to wade through, but a more streamlined layout would be welcome.</p><p> One way to avoid what can feel like a labored navigation experience is to use Alexa. But that doesn’t always make the process any easier. When testing commands like “Tune to ABC” in Hulu Live, we encountered a bunch of error messages. Searching the whole system for content through Alexa can make your life easier. Doing so brings up a menu of choices, displaying content availability on various streaming platforms as well as whether content is free or available for rent or purchase. Once you make a decision, Alexa takes you directly to the content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/grEHZxJFIUgX8TcaLouLrOiXNUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_07-a8725babe7be46ad86619a83a5ca972a.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Price-Affordable-way-to-enjoy-4K-and-upgrade-your-streaming-experience"><a href="#Price-Affordable-way-to-enjoy-4K-and-upgrade-your-streaming-experience" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable way to enjoy 4K and upgrade your streaming experience"></a><strong>Price: Affordable way to enjoy 4K and upgrade your streaming experience</strong></h2><p> At around $450, the Toshiba Fire TV Edition is an attractive option for shoppers who want a smart 4K TV under $500. It’s considerably lighter than other smart TVs that skew more toward the $1,000 price range and offers solid sound and picture quality, plus instant access to myriad streaming apps and services.</p><p> If you’re thinking about cutting the cord with a streaming media player and purchasing a new TV, this Toshiba TV is a solid option that won’t require you to pay through the nose. It’s even more appealing if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber and if you like the idea of a built-in voice assistant.</p><h2 id="Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition-vs-TCL-55S405-55-inch-4K-Ultra-HD-Roku-Smart-LED-TV"><a href="#Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition-vs-TCL-55S405-55-inch-4K-Ultra-HD-Roku-Smart-LED-TV" class="headerlink" title="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch   Fire TV Edition vs. TCL 55S405 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Roku Smart LED TV"></a><strong>Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch</strong>   <strong>Fire TV Edition vs. TCL 55S405 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Roku Smart LED TV</strong></h2><p> If you’re looking for a happy medium between features&#x2F;functionality, saving space, and affordability, the TCL 50S425 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED Roku TV may be a worthy option. This smart 4K television retails for under $400 and blends 4K Ultra HD quality with HDR, resulting in vivid and exceptional picture quality for the price. The Roku TV is not only cheaper than the Toshiba Fire TV Edition, but it’s also 1 pound lighter despite being both slightly taller, wider, and deeper than the Toshiba 55LF711U20.</p><p> The other benefit of the Roku TV is the interface, which is more streamlined than the Fire OS dashboard. If you’re not overly enthusiastic about Alexa or Google Assistant, you could choose to integrate either down the line with the Roku—since it’s compatible with both—or forego them altogether. Alternatively, the Roku app also offers a handy mobile remote and voice control. If you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber you’ll still have easy access to that content through the Prime app, though it won’t be as prominent, which is actually a boon.</p><p> Consider some of our other picks for the best cheap TVs or the best TVs under $500.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A capable smart TV for active Amazon Prime users.</strong></p><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition is a big, bold, affordable 4K smart TV that’s ideal for Amazon Prime subscribers and Alexa users. It offers solid sound and picture quality, especially once you’ve chosen the configuration that work best for your viewing preferences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a

Scheduled for March 19, the bare metal vs. raw power event is set to become a must-watch experience of the annual CloudFest conference.</p><p> According to the dedicated event page,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/39-year-old-477-mhz-dos-web-server-hits-2500-hours-of-uptime" >server <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> throwing began in Holland about a decade ago and is an “intense underground sport, which has been criticized as ‘needlessly brutal to servers’.” This sport is now emerging from its data-center basement origins and is set to enter the world stage at CloudFest 2024.</p><p> CloudFest provides a few details regarding the 2024 World Server Throwing Championship. This outdoor event in front of a live audience will welcome “up to 40 server-throwing athletes.” All genders and ability levels are welcome to participate as long as they desire to throw a server a great distance. Every athlete will get two measured attempts at server throwing and will hope to be placed in the top three so they can win a prize.</p><p> Though the sport is brutal by its very nature, it is good to see that participants at previous events always wear gloves. Some servers have very sharp edges. If you plan to attend, it might be wise to stand behind participants rather than to the left or right in case of server hurling misjudgment.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> It isn’t clear if there are 1U, 2U, and 4U divisions, or, dare we say it, 8U for the real heavy lifters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wtmZvaBCUd7W2J88EkoF6b-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Server throwing athletes"                ></p><p> (Image credit: CloudFest)</p><p> If we had to place a bet on the winner’s nationality, it would probably be Dutch, as the country where the sport seems to have become established. We discovered that some of the WTSC partners have already promoted server throwing in Dutch events. The winner of a Dutch national championship event<a class="link"   href="https://dutchcloudcommunity.nl/agenda/summer-bbq-dutch-cloud-community-2022/" >in 2022 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> managed to fling a 10kg+ (22 pounds +) server 12.23 meters (over 40 feet).</p><p> We think there is plenty of room for improvement on the 2022 winning throw. Remember, the world record distance for throwing a 16-pound shot put is nearly 75 feet. For another comparison, in the Swedish sport of Stångstörtning, a roughly 57-pound log is tossed, with the world record distance being 32 feet. Much will depend on how well-tuned and trained the WSTC 2024 athletes are…</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> The CloudFest 2024 event occurs at Europa-park in Rust,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-submits-schematics-for-1nm-chip-fabs-in-germany-two-new-fabs-open-in-2027" >Germany <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , from March 18 to 24.

Download Video Star App"></a>1. Download Video Star App</h4><p>Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don’t have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone’s native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.</p><h4 id="2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips"><a href="#2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2. Edit Multiple Video Clips"></a>2. Edit Multiple Video Clips</h4><p>After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone’s native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn’t overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.</p><h4 id="3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star"><a href="#3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star" class="headerlink" title="3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star"></a>3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star</h4><p>Video Star also enables you to shoot your videos from the app, and you can adjust the Countdown before the app starts recording or the Recording Speed. Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you’ll be recording like TikTok does on fast.</p><p>Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone’s location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.</p><p>To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you’re not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.</p><p>When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn’t come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video’s shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don’t want to use.</p><p>The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip. Once you’ve edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time.

Download Video Star App</h4><p>Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don’t have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone’s native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.</p><h4 id="2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips-1"><a href="#2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Edit Multiple Video Clips"></a>2. Edit Multiple Video Clips</h4><p>After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone’s native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn’t overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.</p><h4 id="3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star-1"><a href="#3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you’ll be recording like TikTok does on fast.</p><p>Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone’s location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.</p><p>To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you’re not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.</p><p>When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn’t come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video’s shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don’t want to use.</p><p>The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip.

Once you’ve edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time.

What’s more, you will not receive a refund for any in-app purchases you made while you were using TikTok. If you would only like to go on a social media hiatus for a while, the app offers some advanced options that will enable you to keep your account while remaining completely invisible on the platform. Here are some of the solutions you might want to consider before deciding to delete your TikTok account forever.</p><h2 id="3-Alternatives-to-Deleting-a-TikTok-Account-3"><a href="#3-Alternatives-to-Deleting-a-TikTok-Account-3" class="headerlink" title="3 Alternatives to Deleting a TikTok Account"></a>3 Alternatives to Deleting a TikTok Account</h2><p>The platform offers several advanced options to its users that enable them to be hidden from the public eye. That’s why you don’t have to deactivate your TikTok account if you don’t want your music videos to be accessible to other users of the platform. Here are a few alternative options you have at your disposal.</p><h4 id="Set-Privacy-Settings-to-Private-3"><a href="#Set-Privacy-Settings-to-Private-3" class="headerlink" title="Set Privacy Settings to Private"></a>Set Privacy Settings to Private</h4><p>The TikTok app can be used in <strong>Private mode,</strong> even though all accounts on the platform are <strong>Public</strong> when you first create them. All new followers will have to send you a friend request in order to view your videos once you switch to private mode, which enables you to control who can see the content you share on your account. This option can be activated by heading over to the <strong>Settings menu</strong> and choosing the <strong>Privacy and Safety feature.</strong> Afterward, you just have to toggle the <strong>Private Account option</strong> <strong>on</strong>, and after a short while, only your followers will be able to see the content you post on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Prevent-Other-Users-From-Finding-You-3"><a href="#Prevent-Other-Users-From-Finding-You-3" class="headerlink" title="Prevent Other Users From Finding You"></a>Prevent Other Users From Finding You</h4><p>The ‘<strong>Allow others to find me’</strong> option lets you control who can see your profile because if you enable it, your account won’t appear in the friend suggestions other users receive from the platform. You can find this option in the <strong>Privacy and Safety menu</strong>, so you can just switch it off if it’s enabled by default. You can switch it back on whenever you want if at any point you decide that you want to be featured in follower suggestions.</p><h4 id="Control-Who-Can-Send-You-Messages-and-Post-Comments-on-Your-Videos-3"><a href="#Control-Who-Can-Send-You-Messages-and-Post-Comments-on-Your-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Control Who Can Send You Messages and Post Comments on Your Videos"></a>Control Who Can Send You Messages and Post Comments on Your Videos</h4><p>Limiting the number of people who can get in touch with you through TikTok is another way to increase your safety on this video sharing platform. <strong>Who can send me messages,</strong> and <strong>Who can send me comments</strong> options are available in the <strong>Privacy and Safety</strong> menu, so you can easily set both of these options to <strong>Just Friends</strong> if you’d like to avoid receiving messages from TikTok users you don’t know.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The recent updates of the app and the introduction of the Thinking about removing your account option made deleting a TikTok account a quick process. However, this action is permanent and once you deactivate your account, you won’t be able to use it again. That’s why you need to think about this decision through, especially because the app offers a number of ways to increase your privacy.</p><hr><h2 id="Edit-TikTok-Videos-with-Powerful-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Edit-TikTok-Videos-with-Powerful-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Edit TikTok Videos with Powerful Video Editor"></a>Edit TikTok Videos with Powerful Video Editor</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is an awesome video editing software that can easily convert landscape video to a vertical one, which makes it convenient to upload your stunning videos to TikTok.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-expert-guide-to-a-lasting-goodbye-deleting-tiktok-effectively/"><u>[New] Expert Guide to a Lasting Goodbye Deleting TikTok Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-novice-networking-affordable-channel-buy-options/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Novice Networking Affordable Channel Buy Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-professional-editors-showdown-filmora-vs-democracy-creator-features/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Professional Editors Showdown Filmora Vs.

According to Santa Monica Studio, with the option of unlocked framerates and true 4k resolution on supported devices, PC gamers will be able to enjoy the full potential of their cinematic, no-cut camera as it follows Kratos and Atreus across the realms. However, shortly after the game was released, <strong>many players are reporting that God of War FPS drops or stutters on their PC.</strong></p><p> If you find yourself in the same boat, don’t worry. You’ve landed on the right page. After reading this article, you should be able to fix the game fps drops, stuttering, and other performance issues easily!</p><h2 id="Try-these-fixes"><a href="#Try-these-fixes" class="headerlink" title="Try these fixes"></a>Try these fixes</h2><p> Here’s a list of fixes that have resolved the God of War FPS drops for other PC players. You probably don’t have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.</p><ol><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Install the latest game patch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Update your graphics driver <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Change Windows power plan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Optimize in-game graphics settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Modify graphics card settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Disable overlays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Disable background recording and Xbox Game Bar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li></ol><h2 id="Install-the-latest-game-patch"><a href="#Install-the-latest-game-patch" class="headerlink" title="Install the latest game patch"></a>Install the latest game patch</h2><p> The Santa Monica Studio releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.</p><p> If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam or the Epic Games Launcher, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.</p><p> Launch God of War and check if the in-game FPS is back to normal. If the FPS still drops, or if there are no new game patches available, move on to the next fix, below.</p><h2 id="Update-your-graphics-driver"><a href="#Update-your-graphics-driver" class="headerlink" title="Update your graphics driver"></a>Update your graphics driver</h2><p> One of the most common causes of game stuttering (or FPS dropping) is that the graphics driver on your computer is outdated or broken. If you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, you should update or reinstall the driver, since in most cases, AAA titles like God of War work better with the latest graphics driver.</p><p>There are mainly two methods for you to update the graphics driver:</p><p><strong>Manually –</strong> To update your graphics driver to the latest version manually, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website (e.g.<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >NVIDIA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" >AMD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), search and download the exact driver that suits your graphics card and operating system, and then install it manually.</p><p><strong>Automatically –</strong>  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  .</p><p> Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:</p><ol><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  and install Driver Easy.</li><li>Run Driver Easy and click the <strong>Scan Now</strong> button.

You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click <em>Update All</em> .)<br>4. Once the driver is updated, reboot your PC for the changes to take effect.</p><p><strong>The Pro version of Driver Easy</strong> comes with <em>full technical support</em> . If you need assistance, please contact <strong>Driver Easy’s support team</strong> at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >support@drivereasy.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</strong></p><h2 id="Change-Windows-power-plan"><a href="#Change-Windows-power-plan" class="headerlink" title="Change Windows power plan"></a>Change Windows power plan</h2><p> A power plan is a set of system and hardware settings on Windows OS. It’s designed to manage how your computer consumes and conserves power. Generally speaking, the higher the performance, the more power your computer consumes.</p><p> In most cases, the power plan on PCs is configured to be Balanced by default, which may limit the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU. In Windows 10 or Windows 11, you can customize the power plan on your PC, and by doing that, your computer will have a better performance.</p><p> If you’re experiencing performance issues like FPS dropping, try modifying the Power Plan of your PC for High Performance first. Here is how to do it:</p><ol><li>On your keyboard, press <strong>the Windows logo key</strong>  and <strong>R</strong> at the same time, then type <strong>powercfg.cpl</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/run-dialog-powercfg.png"                      alt="run dialog - powercfg.cpl"                ></li><li>In the pop-up window, expand <strong>Hide additional plans</strong> and select <strong>High performance</strong> .</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993651">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993651">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993651%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993651/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/control-panel-power-options.png"                      alt="control panel power options"                ></p><p> Launch God of War and check if you get a better PFS. If the God of War FPS drops again on your powerful computer, try setting the Windows power plan to Ultimate Performance, a power plan that is not widely known, but is designed to make the most out of high-end setups.</p><p> If the Ultimate Performance option doesn’t appear on the power plan list, follow the steps below to unhide it:</p><ol><li>On your keyboard, press<strong>the Windows logo key</strong> and<strong>R</strong> to invoke the<strong>Run box</strong> , type<strong>cmd</strong> and press<strong>Ctrl</strong> ,<strong>Shift</strong> and<strong>Enter</strong> at the same time to run Command Prompt as administrator.</li><li>In the command prompt, paste the following command and press<strong>Enter</strong> .<br><strong><code>powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61</code></strong></li><li>If you see a prompt similar to this, go back to the Power Options window in Control Panel to enable the Ultimate Performance power plan.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change-power-plan-cmd-unhide-ultimate-performance.jpg"                                     ></li></ol><p> See if God of War’s in-game fps improves after changing the power plan.

After all, they’re just a few seconds of a clip at the end of your videos. Why not just let the video end and move on?</p><p>Well, TikTok outros are actually a really important part of the platform. They’re a great way to promote your other social media platforms, give your viewers a call to action, or just show off your personality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-outros-for-tiktok.png"                      alt="create outros for tiktok"                ></p><p>In this article, we’ll show you how to <strong>create an outro for TikTok</strong> that is sure to leave an ever-lasting impression on those watching your content.

Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video</h2><p>The outro is the last section of the video where the credits are displayed, such as the name of the creator, the date the video was created, and any other relevant information.</p><p>An outro is a good chance to thank your viewers for watching, promote your other videos or social channels, and maybe even sneak in a call-to-action.</p><p>Basically, the outro is the last thing your viewers will see, so it’s important to make it count!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/outros-template.png"                      alt="outros template"                ></p><h3 id="Elements-of-an-Outro"><a href="#Elements-of-an-Outro" class="headerlink" title="Elements of an Outro"></a>Elements of an Outro</h3><p>Here are a few basic elements to include in your outro to keep people engaged:</p><ul><li><strong>Subscription:</strong> Make it easy for people to subscribe to your TikTok account so they can automatically get new content as soon as it’s released. Include a call-to-action at the end of each video, telling people how they can subscribe and get the latest content.</li><li><strong>The Next Video to Watch:</strong> If you have other episodes&#x2F;parts of your TikTok videos, let people know what to expect next. This will give them a reason to come back for more.</li><li><strong>Your Social Media Channels:</strong> Let people know where they can find you on other social media platforms so they can connect with you outside of TikTok.
