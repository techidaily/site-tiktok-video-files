Specifically, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and others have grown significantly. This means that there will be an abundance of AI-generated content in the future.However, generative AI also introduces the risk of AI-generated disinformation. Its features make it easier for opportunistic individuals to spread false information. So, let’s explore how generative AI is being utilized for disinformation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Potential-Risks-of-Generative-AI-to-Spread-Disinformation"><a href="#Potential-Risks-of-Generative-AI-to-Spread-Disinformation" class="headerlink" title="Potential Risks of Generative AI to Spread Disinformation"></a>Potential Risks of Generative AI to Spread Disinformation</h2><p> Generative AI poses many threats to people, like taking away jobs, more surveillance, and cyberattacks. And the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-generative-ai-security-issues-will-worsen/" >security problems with AI will get even worse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . But there’s another worry: people can use it to spread lies. Deceptive individuals can use generative AI to share fake news through visual, auditory, or textual content.</p><p>False news can be categorized into three types:</p><ol><li><strong>Misinformation</strong> : Unintended incorrect or false information.</li><li><strong>Disinformation</strong> : Deliberate use of manipulative or deceptive information.</li><li><strong>Malinformation</strong> : Misleading news or an exaggerated version of the truth.</li></ol><p> When<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-are-deepfakes-explained/" >combined with deepfake technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , generative AI tools can make content that looks and sounds real, like pictures, videos, audio clips, and documents. There are many possibilities for creating fake content, so knowing<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-deepfake-videos/" >how to protect yourself from deepfake videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is important.</p><p> Fake news spreaders can generate content in large quantities, making it easier to disseminate among the masses through social media. Targeted disinformation can be employed to influence political campaigns, potentially impacting elections. Additionally, using AI text and image generation tools raises concerns regarding copyright laws, as reported by<a class="link"   href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10922" >the Congressional Research Service <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> : determining ownership of content generated by these tools becomes challenging.</p><p> How will the law address the propagation of fake news through generative AI? Who will be held responsible for spreading false information—the users, developers, or the tools themselves?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Ways-Generative-AI-Can-Be-Used-to-Spread-Disinformation"><a href="#4-Ways-Generative-AI-Can-Be-Used-to-Spread-Disinformation" class="headerlink" title="4 Ways Generative AI Can Be Used to Spread Disinformation"></a>4 Ways Generative AI Can Be Used to Spread Disinformation</h2><p> To stay safe online, everyone needs to understand the risks of generative AI in spreading disinformation, as it comes in many different forms. Here are a few ways it can be used to manipulate people.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Generating-Fake-Content-Online"><a href="#1-Generating-Fake-Content-Online" class="headerlink" title="1. Generating Fake Content Online"></a>1. Generating Fake Content Online</h3><p> Creating fake content using generative AI is a common strategy employed by those who spread false news. They use popular generative AI tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, Bard, Midjourney, and others to produce various types of content. For example,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-chatgpt-can-help-content-creators/" >ChatGPT can help content creators in many ways <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . But it can also generate social media posts or news articles that may deceive people.</p><p> To prove this, I prompted ChatGPT to write a made-up article about the arrest of US President Joe Biden on corruption charges. We also requested it to include statements from relevant authorities to make it seem more believable.</p><p>Here’s the fictitious article that ChatGPT came up with:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-3.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT created a fictitious news article about corruption charges against Joe Biden"                ></p><p> Surprisingly, the output was highly persuasive. It included the names and statements of authoritative figures to make the article more convincing. This shows how anyone can use such tools to generate false news and easily spread it online.</p><h3 id="2-Using-Chatbots-to-Influence-People’s-Opinions"><a href="#2-Using-Chatbots-to-Influence-People’s-Opinions" class="headerlink" title="2. Using Chatbots to Influence People’s Opinions"></a>2. Using Chatbots to Influence People’s Opinions</h3><p> Chatbots that rely on generative AI models can employ various tactics to influence people’s opinions, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Emotional manipulation</strong> : AI can use emotional intelligence models to exploit emotional triggers and biases to shape your perspectives.</li><li><strong>Echo chambers and confirmation bias</strong> : Chatbots can reinforce existing beliefs by creating echo chambers that validate your biases. If you already hold a certain viewpoint, AI can strengthen it by presenting information that aligns with your opinions.</li><li><strong>Social proof and bandwagon effect</strong> : AI can manipulate public sentiment by generating social proof. This can have significant consequences, as it may lead individuals to conform to popular opinions or follow the crowd.</li><li><strong>Targeted personalization</strong> : Chatbots have access to vast amounts of data that they can gather to create personalized profiles. This enables them to customize content based on your preferences. Through targeted personalization, AI can persuade individuals or further strengthen their opinions.</li></ul><p> These examples all illustrate how chatbots can be utilized to mislead people.</p><h3 id="3-Creating-AI-DeepFakes"><a href="#3-Creating-AI-DeepFakes" class="headerlink" title="3. Creating AI DeepFakes"></a>3. Creating AI DeepFakes</h3><p> Someone can use deepfakes to create false videos of an individual saying or doing things they never did. They can use such tools for social engineering or running smear campaigns against others. Moreover, in today’s meme culture, deepfakes can serve as tools for cyberbullying on social media.</p><p> Additionally, political adversaries may use deepfake audio and videos to tarnish the reputation of their opponents, manipulating public sentiment with the help of AI. So<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/future-and-dangers-of-ai-deepfakes/" >AI-generated deepfakes pose numerous threats in the future <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . According to a 2023<a class="link"   href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/deepfaking-it-americas-2024-election-collides-with-ai-boom-2023-05-30/" >Reuters report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the rise of AI technology could impact America’s 2024 elections. The report highlights the accessibility of tools like Midjourney and DALL-E that can easily create fabricated content and influence people’s collective opinions.</p><p> It’s crucial, then, to be able to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-can-you-tell-video-deepfake/" >identify videos created by deepfakes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and distinguish them from originals.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Cloning-Human-Voices"><a href="#4-Cloning-Human-Voices" class="headerlink" title="4. Cloning Human Voices"></a>4. Cloning Human Voices</h3><p> Generative AI, along with deepfake technology, enables the manipulation of someone’s speech. Deepfake technology is advancing rapidly and offers a variety of tools that can replicate anyone’s voice. This allows malicious individuals to impersonate others and deceive unsuspecting individuals. One such example is<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-deepfake-ai-music/" >the use of deepfake music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> You might have come across tools like<a class="link"   href="https://www.resemble.ai/" >Resemble AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://speechify.com/" >Speechify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://fakeyou.com/" >FakeYou <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and others that can mimic the voices of celebrities. While these AI audio tools can be entertaining, they pose significant risks. Scammers can utilize voice cloning techniques for various fraudulent schemes, resulting in financial losses.</p><p> Scammers may use deepfake voices to impersonate your loved ones and call you, pretending to be in distress. With synthetic audio that sounds convincing, they could urge you to send money urgently, leading you to become a victim of their scams. An incident reported by<a class="link"   href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/05/ai-voice-scam/" >The Washington Post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in March 2023 exemplifies this issue: scammers used deepfake voices to convince people that their grandsons were in jail and needed money…</p><h2 id="How-to-Spot-AI-Spread-Disinformation"><a href="#How-to-Spot-AI-Spread-Disinformation" class="headerlink" title="How to Spot AI-Spread Disinformation"></a>How to Spot AI-Spread Disinformation</h2><p> Combating the spread of disinformation facilitated by AI is a pressing issue in today’s world. So how can you spot false information that’s been made by AI?</p><ol><li>Approach online content with skepticism. If you encounter something that seems manipulative or unbelievable, verify it through cross-checking.</li><li>Before trusting a news article or social media post, ensure it originates from a reputable source.</li><li>Watch out for indicators of deepfakes, such as unnatural blinking or facial movements, poor audio quality, distorted or blurry images, and lack of genuine emotion in speech.</li><li>Use fact-checking websites to verify the accuracy of information.</li></ol><p> By following these steps, you can identify and protect yourself from AI-driven misinformation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png"                      border="0"                >Easy and Safe Partition Software &amp; Hard Disk Manager</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Beware-of-Disinformation-Spread-by-AI"><a href="#Beware-of-Disinformation-Spread-by-AI" class="headerlink" title="Beware of Disinformation Spread by AI"></a>Beware of Disinformation Spread by AI</h2><p> Generative software has played a crucial role in advancing AI. Still, they can also be a significant source of disinformation in society. These affordable tools have enabled anyone to create different types of content using sophisticated AI models; their ability to generate content in large quantities and incorporate deepfakes makes them even more dangerous.</p><p> It’s important that you’re aware of the challenges of disinformation in the AI era.

To ensure a smooth gaming experience at all times, you should update the graphics driver to the latest.</p><p>There are two ways to do this:</p><p><strong>Manually</strong> – You can search for the most recent driver that’s corresponding with your operating system from the manufacturers’ websites (<a class="link"   href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" >AMD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" >NVIDIA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), and then download the driver manually.</p><p><strong>Automatically (Recommended)</strong> – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver on your own, you can do it automatically with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p> Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.</p><p> You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Pro version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  it takes just 2 clicks:</p><ol><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  and install Driver Easy.</li><li>Run Driver Easy and click the<strong>Scan Now</strong> button.

This screen-less band is slim and visually unobtrusive, but behind the scenes, it quietly evaluates your tone of voice, moments of activity, and sedentary stints, and also offers up sophisticated sleep data meant to empower you to a better night’s sleep. And unlike the biggest names in the wearable fitness game such as Fitbit and Apple, the Halo band also offers 3D body fat imaging for another insight into wellness tracking.</p><p> As a dedicated fitness tracker user, I was thrown off by the lack of any sort of interface on the Halo, but my full seven-day experience did serve to help me become more aware of my quality of sleep and general activity levels.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/W0-czfRzA-7ixa5VS8Cb4sBcaqM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon_Halo_02-b2292f1ee1b54f4e9990c92e582c5a4b.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Halo"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=11224199&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/copy_boxshot_lyricvideo.png"                      border="0"                >Lyric Video Creator Professional Version</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-An-accessory-that-blends-in"><a href="#Design-An-accessory-that-blends-in" class="headerlink" title="Design: An accessory that blends in"></a>Design: An accessory that blends in</h2><p> The Halo band doesn’t overwhelm the senses. I tested a small-sized band in silver and appreciated the streamlined bracelet style form factor. The fabric strap, which is a mix of sweat-wicking synthetics, has an athleisure look and feel: sporty but not to the degree that it screams sport watch. Rounding out the minimalist look is one sole button on the side of the sensor unit, which is flanked by an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> indicator and one of two internal microphones. The other mic is located on the back, along with the optical sensor; it’s largely undetectable if you manage a close fit.</p><p> Slightly less sophisticated, however, is the charging clip. It’s a boxy bar with a hinge that opens to place the device inside. Because it’s so lightweight—venturing on flimsy—I experienced the clip part slipping and snapping closed before I could place the wearable in the charging cradle. This slightly inelegant charging accessory seems a bit at odds with the more polished tracker design.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4550420&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/pic/f_02.jpg"                      border="0"                >PearlMountain Image Converter</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QHImxX0EsYwunnnS2aNtTX9j80s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon_Halo_03-66da73beea854cd39f6c35c06975ef4e.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Halo"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Comfort-Streamlined-but-not-immune-to-typical-fit-issues"><a href="#Comfort-Streamlined-but-not-immune-to-typical-fit-issues" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Streamlined but not immune to typical fit issues"></a>Comfort: Streamlined but not immune to typical fit issues</h2><p> While the easy-adjusting Velcro strap is a welcome departure from the typical notch-and-clasp closure on most fitness trackers, adjusting the fit or removing the device wasn’t as smooth as I’d expected it to be. The end of the strap is finished with hardware that prevents the strap from coming completely undone from the loop. The band also includes a series of five strong Velcro strips&#x2F;notches that serve as sizing adjusters. This construction helps prevent accidental drops when taking the band on&#x2F;off, which is never a bad thing. On the other hand, though, the Velcro strips are so sturdy that they restricted quick adjustments and made removing the band less swift overall.</p><p> Even with the sizing flexibility Velcro offers, the Halo isn’t immune to the fit troubles any silicone band presents. While the fabric is soft and comfortable against the skin, I still found it difficult to find the best fit for my small wrist. If I started the day with a tighter adjustment (which was very easy to do with this band), by the end of the day, I had to loosen it to account for temperature and swelling fluctuations.</p><p> While the easy-adjusting Velcro strap is a welcome departure from the typical notch-and-clasp closure on most fitness trackers, adjusting the fit or removing the device wasn’t as smooth as I’d expected it to be.</p><p> As for water resistance, I didn’t test the 50-meter swimproof rating of the Halo in a pool, but I did shower with the device for three days. Despite the band’s moisture-wicking band material, it remained damp far longer than was comfortable and compared to a fast-drying silicone band. If you’re an avid swimmer or prefer not to remove your wearable while showering, the sport band option will most likely be the more desirable option.</p><h2 id="Performance-Constantly-monitoring-movement-not-performance"><a href="#Performance-Constantly-monitoring-movement-not-performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Constantly monitoring movement, not performance"></a>Performance: Constantly monitoring movement, not performance</h2><p> While this streamlined device doesn’t log detailed workout metrics, the Halo has the upper hand when it comes to continuously monitoring movement—and sedentary stints throughout the day. Whether you’re sitting at a desk or venture out for an errand, the Halo will capture that and pretty accurately categorize it. It consistently registered walking and running activities, though the readout wasn’t very accurate for the latter. Truthfully, I don’t get the impression that that’s the point of the Halo.</p><p> Instead, the Halo presents all activity data through a convenient point-tracking system. The weekly goal is 150, which converts to 150 minutes of cardiovascular activity, as recommended by the American Heart Association. Periods of movement and exercise count toward this point goal, while periods of non-movement subtract from points earned. It’s a digestible system that offers a new twist on the steps or movement alert functions you’ll find in fitness trackers and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, and others. This system was an encouraging reset from those reminders that sometimes feel more annoying than motivating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FjdFyV6Y4mTXNsqccZ4aEBJNpV0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon_Halo_05-e671ee9f77cc4cee8e2580a2dba449d5.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Halo"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener.</p><p> The Halo also offers around-the-clock heart rate monitoring and quite detailed sleep tracking analysis and explanations of data tracked. The sleep metrics surpass the high-level data I’ve experienced from devices such as the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-sense-review-5085832" >Fitbit Sense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-fit2-review-5094526" >Samsung Fit2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and helped me feel more attuned to how I was sleeping each night based on my sleep score, disturbances logged, and how long it took me to fall asleep.</p><p> But the most buzzed-about<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/smart-watches-and-wearables-4781531" >wearable technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the Halo offers is voice tone and body fat analysis. While I don’t have constant meetings throughout the day that would have helped with this data, it was interesting to review the Halo band’s observations about tone changes during personal and professional conversations. These “notable moments” are expressed with an emoji that signifies one of four tones ranging from displeased to amused. You can’t drill down further to see which moment the Halo captured, but this tool seems to promote more self-awareness of how you might sound to others more than anything else.</p><p> All voice data and images used for the body scan are deletable from the app, though you can also choose to back up body data in the cloud, which Amazon assures is private and well secured.</p><p> The body fat scan is based on pictures uploaded to the app—and based on prompts from the app. While it felt invasive and isn’t a feature I’d seek out in a fitness tracker, it worked without issue. Amazon reports that this technology is twice as accurate as smart scales. For the right user who feels comfortable with this kind of data compilation, this feature also offers visualizations of how different body fat percentages would look on your frame and stores your scans for a look at trends over time. All voice data and images used for the body scan are deletable from the app, though you can also choose to back up body data in the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-cloud-computing-817770" >cloud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which Amazon assures is private and well secured.</p><h2 id="Software-An-essential-and-user-friendly-mobile-app"><a href="#Software-An-essential-and-user-friendly-mobile-app" class="headerlink" title="Software: An essential and user-friendly mobile app"></a>Software: An essential and user-friendly mobile app</h2><p> Without a visual display to interact with, the accompanying Halo mobile app is absolutely essential to the user experience. It delivers helpful explanations and guidance that most users want.

Sleep data is backed up by explanations as is the activity point tracking system. Automatically tracked workout data is also easily accessible and so is the option to manually upload workout activities (there are 38 to choose from, including an all-encompassing Other category).</p><p> Without a visual display to interact with, the accompanying Halo mobile app is absolutely essential to the user experience.</p><p> Like Fitbit, the Halo also comes with a free 6-month trial to a Halo membership, which includes various guided wellness programs from the Discover tab of the app. I followed along with various circuit, HIIT, and equipment-free workouts all of which offered some sort of video to follow along with as well as audio instructions. The Halo band would certainly lack the same sort of appeal without access to these programs that are great if you want to sneak in a quick workout, or you’re an avid at-home exerciser who likes to mix things up.</p><p> The app makes everything from the initial setup to body scanning and voice tracking straightforward.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Enough-juice-to-last-nearly-a-week"><a href="#Battery-Enough-juice-to-last-nearly-a-week" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Enough juice to last nearly a week"></a>Battery: Enough juice to last nearly a week</h2><p> Amazon says that with tone tracking enabled, the band should last up to seven days on a single charge. There are two options for tracking tone: one for more accuracy and one to optimize battery life. I chose the latter and found that the band lasted for six days, which comes close to the manufacturer’s claims. I also noticed that by manually muting the mic, the battery drained far less quickly than when I left it on to listen at all times.</p><p> While this isn’t the longest-lasting battery, it was rapid to charge at just about 1 hour and 15 minutes. It was also easy to keep track of battery life and avoid inadvertently over-charging the device, thanks to system notifications that popped up on my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-makes-a-smartphone-smart-579597" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when my band battery was low as well as when it was fully charged and ready to go again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fBsShcBruhAWkg-kTKPWkYUaImo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon_Halo_04-ee532fbe8d2f4e8195e63ed9dd45611a.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Halo"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Price-A-reasonable-price-for-the-feature-set"><a href="#Price-A-reasonable-price-for-the-feature-set" class="headerlink" title="Price: A reasonable price for the feature set"></a>Price: A reasonable price for the feature set</h2><p> Retailing for just about $100, the Amazon Halo band certainly won’t break the bank for budget-minded shoppers. While the lack of display could be a deterrent, the solid mobile app provides convenient access to the detailed sleep, automatic activity tracking, and specialized tone of voice and body fat analysis the Halo provides.</p><h2 id="Amazon-Halo-vs-WHOOP-Strap-3"><a href="#Amazon-Halo-vs-WHOOP-Strap-3" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Halo vs. WHOOP Strap 3"></a>Amazon Halo vs. WHOOP Strap 3</h2><p> The WHOOP Strap 3 is another screen-less fitness tracker with a minimalist bent but a bigger buy-in and emphasis on performance. Unlike the Halo, the WHOOP Strap requires a WHOOP membership, which, at the lowest end, costs $30 monthly for a 6-month membership or $180 total (band included). The Halo band comes with a free six-month subscription to Halo app services, then a $3.99 monthly charge, so it’s considerably cheaper—especially since WHOOP recommends replacing their fabric strap every six months as well.</p><p> The WHOOP Strap does come with many more strap color and accessory options than the Halo, including custom engraving. Battery life is slightly behind at about five days, but you can access data on a desktop, and there’s a social aspect to the WHOOP platform that the Halo lacks. While both options forego a busy screen for streamlined wrist-based trackers and feature-rich companion apps, the best choice for you will likely come down to whether the athletic performance tracking of the WHOOP appeals over the wellness-tuned Halo.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A futuristic wearable for wellness enthusiasts.</strong></p><p> The Amazon Halo isn’t for everyone with its lack of display and additional layers of data tracking to capture tone of voice and body fat percentage. But for the user that wants a little less hardware but more forward-thinking fitness&#x2F;health tracking, this unique wearable offers a different approach to increasing activity and wellness awareness on a daily basis.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296855&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload

If your graphics driver is faulty or outdated, you’re likely to encounter a black screen in Minecraft. To fix it,<strong>make sure you’re using the latest graphics driver</strong> .</p><p> You can search for the newest graphics driver from the GPU manufacturer’s website such as <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >NVIDIA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  , <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" >AMD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  or <strong><a class="link"   href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics" >Intel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  , then download and install it manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  .</p><p> Driver Easy is a helpful tool, which can automatically recognize your system, find the correct drivers for your exact graphics, and your Windows version, then download and install them correctly.</p><ol><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  and install Driver Easy.</li><li>Run Driver Easy and click the<strong>Scan Now</strong> button.

To fix it, you can reset your video settings to default. Here’s how:</p><ol><li><strong>Close</strong> Minecraft.</li><li>On your keyboard, press the<strong>Windows logo key</strong> and<strong>E</strong> at the same time to open File Explorer.</li><li>Copy the following file address and paste it to the address bar, then press<strong>Enter</strong> .<br> File address: <strong>%LocalAppData%PackagesMicrosoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbweLocalStategamescom.mojangminecraftpe</strong><br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/file-explorer.jpg"                                     ></li><li>Open the<strong>options.txt</strong> file, then find the line with the following entry, and change the number to 4, like so:<strong>gfx_msaa:4</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gfx_msaa-4.jpg"                                     ></li><li><strong>Save</strong> the options.txt file.</li><li>Relaunch Minecraft to see if the problem is solved.</li></ol><p> Alternatively, you can delete the options.txt file, and then relaunch Minecraft, and a new one will be generated with default settings for all options.</p><p>If this method doesn’t do the trick, continue to the next fix.</p><h3 id="Fix-5-Close-unnecessary-programs"><a href="#Fix-5-Close-unnecessary-programs" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Close unnecessary programs"></a>Fix 5: Close unnecessary programs</h3><p> If you’re running multiple programs at the same time when playing Minecraft, there is a chance that one of your programs conflicts with the game. Besides, too many applications running in the background will consume more resources, which could cause the black screen issue. So we recommend that you close all unnecessary programs during the gameplay. To do so:</p><ol><li>On your keyboard, press<strong>Ctrl</strong> ,<strong>Shift</strong> and<strong>Esc</strong> at the same time to open Task Manager.</li><li>One at a time, select the resource-hogging program and click<strong>End task</strong> .  <!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851655&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a><!-- affiliate ads end --><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/end-task-1.jpg"                                     ></li></ol><p> Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with.

This 55-inch LED smart TV combines affordability with Alexa, Amazon Prime content, and access to over 500,000 episodes across your favorite streaming platforms. We thoroughly tested the Toshiba’s picture quality, display settings, and the Fire OS interface and usability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pCLBMqSK1Hi3ePW2jzUkDycA2IU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_04-f1f62a55ea504fc9aa98fc9e14527ba7.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2067133&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/gcb/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >Greeting Card Builder</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Best-for-a-bigger-room"><a href="#Design-Best-for-a-bigger-room" class="headerlink" title="Design: Best for a bigger room"></a><strong>Design: Best for a bigger room</strong></h2><p> The Toshiba 55-inch Fire TV is not a small device. While it only weighs 31.3 pounds with the stand (though the stand itself weighs less than a pound), it’s both tall and wide enough to make moving and installing it a two-person job. The TV’s dimensions with the stand are 27.8 inches tall, 44.6 inches wide, and 10.7 inches deep, and the screen size (on a diagonal) measures at 49.5 inches.</p><p> There’s no wall mount included in the box, but there are four standard VESA mounting holes on the back of the unit for safe and easy installation. In a smaller space, wall-mounting this television might not be a bad idea. Even in the relatively modestly-sized room where we tested the TV, it nearly completely took up the entire shelf where we placed it and a broad swath of the wall behind it. This TV is not particularly thin and actually tends to be a bit bulky in the very back of the unit, and the stand also adds width. The legs splay out and require a wide, long surface to accommodate them.</p><p> An attractive option for shoppers who want a smart 4K TV under $500.</p><p> The other important component is the Alexa-enabled remote, which is small, lightweight, and contains a circular dial with directional controls and play&#x2F;pause functionality. You also have the benefit of summoning Alexa with the touch of the speaker button, which is intuitively placed at the top of the remote (though we often accidentally hit it when we were trying to push the Home button, which is right below it).</p><p> The buttons are clearly laid out on the remote, and it’s convenient to have volume and mute controls in addition to a shortcut button to antenna channels. There are also some shortcut buttons as well: Prime Video, Nextflix, HBO, and Vue.</p><p> There are some downsides to the remote’s overall quality. Unlike other Fire TV remotes that create a completely smooth and seamless effect on the back, this remote is a lot more traditional, with a tab for pulling off the battery cover. It makes an unfortunate creaking noise almost every time you push a button, and while it never fell off the noise was distracting and contributed to the plastic and flimsy feel of the remote.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B300x600%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-300x600.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/bohXBE5CBPeYtI5seooxoQhyzkY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_02-781cfad0cacf41878e3ffb24afd56c6e.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Quick and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Quick and easy</strong></h2><p> There is a little setup required out of the box, whether you wall mount it or attach the stand.

Each leg requires both a longer 35 mm screw to help create a secure attachment to the bottom of the TV and two 10 mm screws that secure the legs to the back of the unit.</p><p> Installing the legs isn’t complicated, but it can be awkward because you need to place the TV screen-side down on a soft or cushioned surface. It helps to have a bit of space to do this either on a sofa or a clean, carpeted area, and maybe a helping hand to situate the TV wherever you plan to put it.</p><p> Once the legs were in place, we placed the TV on a table and plugged in the power cord. The TV powered on immediately and we were prompted to press the play&#x2F;pause button on the remote to begin setup.</p><p> We were guided through a quick process of connecting to Wi-Fi, signing in with Amazon account credentials, and registering the TV to our account. While you can enjoy this television without an existing Amazon account, you will have to create one in order to complete setup and gain access to all apps. The whole setup only takes a few moments, though, and we were on the Home screen of the Fire OS interface before we knew it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599951&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>Epubor Ultimate for Win：Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Gg5qCbaSxBZF2n4hLJ-UWMjX7vk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_05-ea81ea03abde49c3856c921f1321d024.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crisp-but-sometimes-needs-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crisp-but-sometimes-needs-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crisp but sometimes needs tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crisp but sometimes needs tweaking</strong></h2><p> While setting up the TV was very fast and took only a few minutes, we did have to spend some time adjusting the picture settings. Unfortunately, this is not something the online user manual provides much insight about.</p><p> We headed straight for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> content on Amazon Prime and played a number of movies and TV series. What we found was that it consistently took about a minute for the picture to kick into Ultra HD<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The default standard picture settings yielded an incredibly dark picture with too much contrast. The reds were very exaggerated and the low-light scenes, especially scenes at night, were very difficult to see.</p><p> Accessing the HDR picture settings is not exactly intuitive. Long-pressing the Home button on the remote brings up a shortcut menu and that’s where we were able to access HDR picture settings. Picture settings can be found under Display and Sounds in the main Settings menu, but there’s only a blanket setting for all app and video content. Settings that work for regular HD content, which was the majority of the content we viewed, were inadequate for HDR content.</p><p>Ultra HD HDR content shines in a realistic and rich way.</p><p> For the best Ultra HD HDR picture quality, we found that changing to movie mode instead of standard smoothed out the saturation a bit. For good measure we also turned off Dynamic Backlight, HDR Tone Mapping, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mpeg-file-2622031" >MPEG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Noise Reduction. This helped the Ultra HD HDR content shine in a realistic and rich way.</p><p> Another image quality issue we encountered was<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macroblocking-and-pixelation-1847333" >video artifacts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which are glitches and distortions in picture quality. This can be a result of data loss due to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-media-file-compression-1847431" >media file compression <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , signal interference, or other factors. It was a particular problem when viewing HD Amazon Prime content, but we also observed it in Hulu content. Turning off Edge Enhancer and Motion Processing from the picture settings menu helped eliminate artifacting when streaming media, but it didn’t resolve this issue when we watched live TV via Hulu. There we got long sequences of pixelated content and macroblocking, where the image appeared broken up into blocky chunks.</p><p> We did switch the picture mode to Game when playing an HD game, but didn’t notice a significant difference in quality. The picture was already quite vibrant and clear without making this switch, and the only discernible difference was that Game mode made color tones a bit more saturated. Presumably the panel is deactivating some post-processing to improve input lag, but we didn’t notice a significant difference in either quality or latency.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-office-pdf-editor-1x.890dbda.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KHIDIBlAKmxc6ZGa6AocjOoGEpY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_06-1fe0d195f3844b89822833f4c0f4d69e.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png"                      border="0"                >Easy and Safe Partition Software &amp; Hard Disk Manager</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Well-rounded-and-clear"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Well-rounded-and-clear" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Well-rounded and clear"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Well-rounded and clear</strong></h2><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 is outfitted with two 10-watt speakers enhanced with DTS Studio Sound. According to DTS, this technology smooths transitions, volume, and bass levels while changing channels or sources.</p><p> Audio quality isn’t spectacular but is generally consistent and clear across media. The volume can get quite loud and fill the room, which is good if you don’t plan to add additional home-entertainment speakers. There are also bass, treble, and balancing settings that help cater to your individual EQ preferences.</p><p> Like the suite of picture settings, there are sound modes to achieve the most appropriate audio experience based on what media you’re consuming. These modes include Standard, Movie, Music, Clear Voice, and a user-defined Custom mode. Movie mode seemed to work out best for our preferences, yielding neither an extremely tinny nor bassy sound.</p><p> There are also the DTS TruSurround and TruVolume controls—TruSurround is on by default and functions to create a richer and more amplified sound, but TruVolume is off. Flipping it on helped control and even out fluctuations in sound, which was a problem we encountered streaming some content on Netflix and Hulu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FdoBEgX__hYz6EgBVAeh47z5pyg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_03-39faf55a89c8450cbddcb795f2f0fcc8.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Easy-to-use-but-cluttered"><a href="#Software-Easy-to-use-but-cluttered" class="headerlink" title="Software: Easy to use but cluttered"></a><strong>Software: Easy to use but cluttered</strong></h2><p> This Toshiba TV runs on Fire OS, which is easy to interact with but has some quirks. As an Amazon product it feature Amazon Prime content first and foremost, which may be convenient for Prime subscribers but is slightly less so if you’re primarily looking for Netflix or Hulu content. We found that the remote occasionally lagged if we didn’t point it directly toward the TV sensors, and virtually any time we loaded and exited apps or spun up Prime content. Loading time varied from a few seconds to upwards of ten. There’s also an odd bug when exiting out of the Hulu app. It routinely took about five seconds before the system got us back to the Home dashboard, before which it would take us to the Hulu home page.</p><p> The Fire OS Home menu is the spot that features recent apps, downloaded apps, as well as suggested content based on viewing activity. This arrangement is clear enough, but wading through options becomes more confusing based on the other menu pages, which include Movies, Live, TV Shows, Apps, and Your Videos. Much of the content you’ll see across these pages is duplicated, so overlap is a part of the user experience, which means clutter and confusion. Once you get a handle on this arrangement it’s easy enough to wade through, but a more streamlined layout would be welcome.</p><p> One way to avoid what can feel like a labored navigation experience is to use Alexa. But that doesn’t always make the process any easier. When testing commands like “Tune to ABC” in Hulu Live, we encountered a bunch of error messages. Searching the whole system for content through Alexa can make your life easier. Doing so brings up a menu of choices, displaying content availability on various streaming platforms as well as whether content is free or available for rent or purchase. Once you make a decision, Alexa takes you directly to the content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/grEHZxJFIUgX8TcaLouLrOiXNUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_07-a8725babe7be46ad86619a83a5ca972a.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Price-Affordable-way-to-enjoy-4K-and-upgrade-your-streaming-experience"><a href="#Price-Affordable-way-to-enjoy-4K-and-upgrade-your-streaming-experience" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable way to enjoy 4K and upgrade your streaming experience"></a><strong>Price: Affordable way to enjoy 4K and upgrade your streaming experience</strong></h2><p> At around $450, the Toshiba Fire TV Edition is an attractive option for shoppers who want a smart 4K TV under $500. It’s considerably lighter than other smart TVs that skew more toward the $1,000 price range and offers solid sound and picture quality, plus instant access to myriad streaming apps and services.</p><p> If you’re thinking about cutting the cord with a streaming media player and purchasing a new TV, this Toshiba TV is a solid option that won’t require you to pay through the nose. It’s even more appealing if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber and if you like the idea of a built-in voice assistant.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467"                      border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition-vs-TCL-55S405-55-inch-4K-Ultra-HD-Roku-Smart-LED-TV"><a href="#Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition-vs-TCL-55S405-55-inch-4K-Ultra-HD-Roku-Smart-LED-TV" class="headerlink" title="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch   Fire TV Edition vs. TCL 55S405 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Roku Smart LED TV"></a><strong>Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch</strong>   <strong>Fire TV Edition vs. TCL 55S405 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Roku Smart LED TV</strong></h2><p> If you’re looking for a happy medium between features&#x2F;functionality, saving space, and affordability, the TCL 50S425 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED Roku TV may be a worthy option. This smart 4K television retails for under $400 and blends 4K Ultra HD quality with HDR, resulting in vivid and exceptional picture quality for the price. The Roku TV is not only cheaper than the Toshiba Fire TV Edition, but it’s also 1 pound lighter despite being both slightly taller, wider, and deeper than the Toshiba 55LF711U20.</p><p> The other benefit of the Roku TV is the interface, which is more streamlined than the Fire OS dashboard. If you’re not overly enthusiastic about Alexa or Google Assistant, you could choose to integrate either down the line with the Roku—since it’s compatible with both—or forego them altogether. Alternatively, the Roku app also offers a handy mobile remote and voice control. If you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber you’ll still have easy access to that content through the Prime app, though it won’t be as prominent, which is actually a boon.</p><p> Consider some of our other picks for the best cheap TVs or the best TVs under $500.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A capable smart TV for active Amazon Prime users.</strong></p><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition is a big, bold, affordable 4K smart TV that’s ideal for Amazon Prime subscribers and Alexa users. It offers solid sound and picture quality, especially once you’ve chosen the configuration that work best for your viewing preferences.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a

According to Santa Monica Studio, with the option of unlocked framerates and true 4k resolution on supported devices, PC gamers will be able to enjoy the full potential of their cinematic, no-cut camera as it follows Kratos and Atreus across the realms. However, shortly after the game was released, <strong>many players are reporting that God of War FPS drops or stutters on their PC.</strong></p><p> If you find yourself in the same boat, don’t worry. You’ve landed on the right page.

It’s designed to manage how your computer consumes and conserves power. Generally speaking, the higher the performance, the more power your computer consumes.</p><p> In most cases, the power plan on PCs is configured to be Balanced by default, which may limit the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU. In Windows 10 or Windows 11, you can customize the power plan on your PC, and by doing that, your computer will have a better performance.</p><p> If you’re experiencing performance issues like FPS dropping, try modifying the Power Plan of your PC for High Performance first. Here is how to do it:</p><ol><li>On your keyboard, press <strong>the Windows logo key</strong>  and <strong>R</strong> at the same time, then type <strong>powercfg.cpl</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/run-dialog-powercfg.png"                      alt="run dialog - powercfg.cpl"                ></li><li>In the pop-up window, expand <strong>Hide additional plans</strong> and select <strong>High performance</strong> .  <!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713324&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVTV1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV TV Webcaster</a><!-- affiliate ads end --><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/control-panel-power-options.png"                      alt="control panel power options"                ></li></ol><p> Launch God of War and check if you get a better PFS. If the God of War FPS drops again on your powerful computer, try setting the Windows power plan to Ultimate Performance, a power plan that is not widely known, but is designed to make the most out of high-end setups.</p><p> If the Ultimate Performance option doesn’t appear on the power plan list, follow the steps below to unhide it:</p><ol><li>On your keyboard, press<strong>the Windows logo key</strong> and<strong>R</strong> to invoke the<strong>Run box</strong> , type<strong>cmd</strong> and press<strong>Ctrl</strong> ,<strong>Shift</strong> and<strong>Enter</strong> at the same time to run Command Prompt as administrator.</li><li>In the command prompt, paste the following command and press<strong>Enter</strong> .<br><strong><code>powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61</code></strong></li><li>If you see a prompt similar to this, go back to the Power Options window in Control Panel to enable the Ultimate Performance power plan.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change-power-plan-cmd-unhide-ultimate-performance.jpg"                                     ></li></ol><p> See if God of War’s in-game fps improves after changing the power plan.

If you have a powerful PC, just skip this fix.</p><p> Normally, the in-game PFS will increase after you lower the following in-game graphics settings:</p><ul><li><strong>Texture quality</strong> : Low</li><li><strong>Model quality</strong> : Original</li><li><strong>Anisotropic Filter</strong> : Minimum</li><li><strong>Shadows</strong> : Original</li><li><strong>Atmospherics</strong> : Low</li><li><strong>Ambient Occlusion</strong> : Disable</li><li><strong>Film Grain</strong> : lower it to 0 if necessary</li><li><strong>DLSS</strong> : Balanced</li><li><strong>FidelityFX Super Resolution</strong> : Quality</li></ul><p> You also set to quality preset to Original or Low to gain more performance.</p><p> Re-launch God of War after you modified the in-game graphics settings and see if its FPS still drops, try the next fix, below.</p><h2 id="Modify-graphics-card-settings"><a href="#Modify-graphics-card-settings" class="headerlink" title="Modify graphics card settings"></a>Modify graphics card settings</h2><p> If you didn’t modify your graphics card settings, then you should give it a try. According to many PC gamers, tweaking the graphics card settings in Nvidia or AMD control panel may also improve the in-game FPS.</p><p><strong>For Nvidia users</strong> , follow the steps below:</p><ol><li><strong>Right-click</strong> on your desktop and select <strong>NVIDIA Control Panel</strong> from the context menu.</li><li>Click <strong>Manage 3D Settings</strong> on the left, then navigate to the <strong>Program Settings</strong> tab. In the <strong>Select a program to customize:</strong>  part, add <strong>God of War</strong> from the program list.</li><li>In the <strong>Specify the settings for this program</strong> section, modify the following settings:<br><strong>Max Frame Rate</strong> : Set it to a frame rate below your monitor’s current refresh rate.<br><strong>OpenGL rendering GPU</strong> : Set it to your Nvidia GPU<br><strong>Power Management</strong> : <strong>Prefer Maximum Performance</strong><br><strong>Low Latency Mode</strong> : <strong>Ultra</strong><br><strong>Vertical sync</strong> : <strong>Fast</strong><br><strong>Texture filtering – Quality</strong> : <strong>Performance</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to save the changes.</li></ol><p><strong>For AMD users</strong> , follow the steps below:</p><ol><li>Open <strong>AMD Radeon Settings</strong> .</li><li>Go to <strong>Gaming</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Global Settings</strong> .

Close unnecessary programs"></a>1. Close unnecessary programs</h2><p> Programs like browsers, game launchers, anti-virus software are CPU intensive. So if you have them running in the background when playing Splitgate, you’re most likely to suffer from game stutters. To fix that, you should end programs that you don’t need to be running when in-game. But be cautious that you should not end processes that are essential for running Windows, otherwise your computer may fail to work properly.</p><ol><li>On your keyboard, press the<strong>Windows logo + R keys</strong> simultaneously to open the Run box.</li><li>Type<strong>taskmgr</strong> and press Enter.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png"                      alt="open Task Manager"                ><br>3.

One of the most common causes of this problem is an outdated or a faulty sound card driver.</p><p> There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your sound card: manually or automatically.</p><p><strong>Manual driver update</strong> – You can update your sound card driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your computer, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.</p><p><strong>Automatic driver update</strong> – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your sound card drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with<a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/"><strong>Driver Easy</strong></a> .</p><p> Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact sound card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:</p><ol><li>Download and install<a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/"><strong>Driver Easy</strong></a> .</li><li>Run Driver Easy and click the<strong>Scan Now</strong> button.
