The “Green Screen Duet Feature.” This feature also lets users apply another person’s video as the background.</p><p>Green screens were once only available to those who had access to, well, a green screen. Now the case is different. You can utilize this “Green Screen” feature from the various applications now, allowing you to add a customizable background to your video, and TikTok is one of them. s Various content creators customize their background with effects, a still image, or even a video from their camera roll using the TikTok app.</p><p>Imagine scrolling down the TikTok app and finding an eye-catching customized background. Yes! You can utilize it to spice up your videos as well. We have already demonstrated how you can add a green screen effect in TikTok in your videos. But did you also know you can add green screen background from someone else’s video to your TikTok? Even if you didn’t, we have compiled a step-by-step guide that will give you a perfect depiction of how you can pull it off.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Search the Video with Green Screen Effects on TikTok</strong></p><p>First and foremost, launch the TikTok app on your phone. Either navigate the video with a green screen effect or type <strong>Green Screen</strong> in the <strong>Search Box</strong> to find a video. Open the video and click on the Green Screen Effect in the bottom left of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-green-screen-effect-from-others-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="get green screen effects from others in TikTok"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Make Your Video with the Green Screen Effect</strong></p><p>Now, you can record your TikTok video with the green-screen effect used.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-TikTok-Video-Background-without-Green-Screen-in-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-TikTok-Video-Background-without-Green-Screen-in-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change TikTok Video Background without Green Screen in Filmora?"></a>Part 3: How to Change TikTok Video Background without Green Screen in Filmora?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most popular video editing software among YouTubers.

It needs a very few mouse clicks, and it works the best when there are people next to the camera.</p><p>After you’ve eliminated the background, you’ll be able to see the primary foreground of your video in live time. You can then supplement your actual video with a picture or a background. You can also use the video without the background as an intermediate layer on top of another video. Follow the below steps to change the video background using this feature:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import Video to Timeline</strong></p><p>Launch Filmora on your Windows PC or Mac, and then import the video to the timeline by clicking on the <strong>File</strong> and then <strong>Import Media</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Apply Human Segmentation</strong></p><p>Go to <strong>Effects</strong> and then select the <strong>AI Portrait</strong> to see all of the AI Portrait effects.

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out <strong>how to do Siri voice on TikTok</strong> without any hassle in the next part!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?"></a>Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</h2><p>To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141684/17092" target="_top" id="2141684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141684/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer-3"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!</p><p>The reason?</p><p>Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!</p><p>This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.</p><p>So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?</p><p>To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.</p><p>And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.</p><h2 id="Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright"><a href="#Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?"></a><strong>Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?</strong></h2><p>To avoid getting banned!</p><p>You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.</p><p>The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.</p><p>If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.</p><p>To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.</p><p>But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?</p><p>Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading"><a href="#Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading" class="headerlink" title="Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading"></a><strong>Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading</strong></h2><p>Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it.

After all, they’re just a few seconds of a clip at the end of your videos. Why not just let the video end and move on?</p><p>Well, TikTok outros are actually a really important part of the platform. They’re a great way to promote your other social media platforms, give your viewers a call to action, or just show off your personality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-outros-for-tiktok.png"                      alt="create outros for tiktok"                ></p><p>In this article, we’ll show you how to <strong>create an outro for TikTok</strong> that is sure to leave an ever-lasting impression on those watching your content. In the end, we’ll recommend the best video editors that you can use to make your videos engaging by creating the perfect outros every time.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Things-You-Should-Know-About-the-Outro-in-a-Video"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Things-You-Should-Know-About-the-Outro-in-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video"></a>Part 1. Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video</h2><p>The outro is the last section of the video where the credits are displayed, such as the name of the creator, the date the video was created, and any other relevant information.</p><p>An outro is a good chance to thank your viewers for watching, promote your other videos or social channels, and maybe even sneak in a call-to-action.</p><p>Basically, the outro is the last thing your viewers will see, so it’s important to make it count!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/outros-template.png"                      alt="outros template"                ></p><h3 id="Elements-of-an-Outro"><a href="#Elements-of-an-Outro" class="headerlink" title="Elements of an Outro"></a>Elements of an Outro</h3><p>Here are a few basic elements to include in your outro to keep people engaged:</p><ul><li><strong>Subscription:</strong> Make it easy for people to subscribe to your TikTok account so they can automatically get new content as soon as it’s released. Include a call-to-action at the end of each video, telling people how they can subscribe and get the latest content.</li><li><strong>The Next Video to Watch:</strong> If you have other episodes&#x2F;parts of your TikTok videos, let people know what to expect next. This will give them a reason to come back for more.</li><li><strong>Your Social Media Channels:</strong> Let people know where they can find you on other social media platforms so they can connect with you outside of TikTok. This is a great way to build relationships with your viewers.</li><li><strong>Use Stunning Visuals:</strong> Usually, viewers skip outros just like any movie credits showing on a black screen with names on it. However, if you try to create a short TikTok outro with stunning visuals, impressive background sound, and a bit of flair, you are bound to get more followers.</li></ul><h3 id="How-To-Make-an-Advanced-Good-Outro"><a href="#How-To-Make-an-Advanced-Good-Outro" class="headerlink" title="How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?"></a>How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?</h3><p>If you want your TikTok video to go viral, you are required to have a good outro, meaning that you need to have a format that is consistent with the main body of your video, a length that is appropriate, and a call to action that is effective.</p><p>To <strong>create a good outro for your TikTok</strong>, follow the below tips:</p><ul><li>Make sure that your outro is in the same format as the rest of your TikTok video. This means that if your TikTok is mainly conversation, your outro should be as well.</li><li>Keep your outro short and sweet because you don’t want to bore your listeners with a long one. The ideal outro duration should not be more than 15 to 20 seconds.</li><li>Your outro should include a call to action. This could be something like asking your listeners to subscribe to your TikTok, follow, and share your content.</li><li>Make your outros visually appealing and make use of colors and&#x2F;or patterns that are pleasing to the eye.</li><li>Add positive words and phrases to your outros to have a good impact on your viewers.</li><li>Use branding elements like your logo or channel name.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-An-Excellent-Video-Editor-for-Your-TikTok-Adventure"><a href="#Part-2-An-Excellent-Video-Editor-for-Your-TikTok-Adventure" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.</p><p>The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.</p><p>If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.</p><p>To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.</p><p>But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?</p><p>Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading"><a href="#Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading" class="headerlink" title="Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading"></a><strong>Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading</strong></h2><p>Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it.
