But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!</p><p>The reason?</p><p>Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!</p><p>This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.</p><p>So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?</p><p>To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.</p><p>And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.</p><h2 id="Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright"><a href="#Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?"></a><strong>Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?</strong></h2><p>To avoid getting banned!</p><p>You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.</p><p>The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.</p><p>If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.</p><p>To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.</p><p>But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?</p><p>Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading"><a href="#Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading" class="headerlink" title="Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading"></a><strong>Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading</strong></h2><p>Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it.

Open the video and click on the Green Screen Effect in the bottom left of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-green-screen-effect-from-others-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="get green screen effects from others in TikTok"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Make Your Video with the Green Screen Effect</strong></p><p>Now, you can record your TikTok video with the green-screen effect used.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-TikTok-Video-Background-without-Green-Screen-in-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-TikTok-Video-Background-without-Green-Screen-in-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change TikTok Video Background without Green Screen in Filmora?"></a>Part 3: How to Change TikTok Video Background without Green Screen in Filmora?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most popular video editing software among YouTubers. With the latest Auto-Reframe feature, you can create social media videos easier and faster. With Filmora, you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >change backgrounds in your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in various ways, with or without a green screen.</p><p>The Human Segmentation effect in Filmora’s AI Portrait lets you eliminate people from a movie’s background instead of using a green screen. It needs a very few mouse clicks, and it works the best when there are people next to the camera.</p><p>After you’ve eliminated the background, you’ll be able to see the primary foreground of your video in live time. You can then supplement your actual video with a picture or a background. You can also use the video without the background as an intermediate layer on top of another video. Follow the below steps to change the video background using this feature:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import Video to Timeline</strong></p><p>Launch Filmora on your Windows PC or Mac, and then import the video to the timeline by clicking on the <strong>File</strong> and then <strong>Import Media</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Apply Human Segmentation</strong></p><p>Go to <strong>Effects</strong> and then select the <strong>AI Portrait</strong> to see all of the AI Portrait effects. Move the human segmentation effect to the video timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-human-segmentation-filmora.jpg"                      alt="add human segmentation to remove tiktok video background"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Adjust the Effect Setting (Optional)</strong></p><p>In the preview window, you’ll notice that the subject has been separated from the video background. If necessary, double-click the video in the timeline and find the video effect field to modify the edge, thickness, and feather. You can also try the neon borders and glowing flow effects under the AI Portrait category to have some fun.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-human-segmentation-setting.jpg"                      alt="adjust human segmentation in Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Change the Background</strong></p><p>Now, drop the background video to the track below the video clip to change the video background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-background-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="change tiktok video background in Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Export the video with new background</strong></p><p>Preview the final result and then click the Export button to save the video on your computer.</p><p>Note: Check this guide to find out <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>how to upload TikTok videos on your desktop</em></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>To lure the viewer’s attention, there is always a necessity to create visual and audio effects in a TikTok video. A TikTok video maker may not always have the privilege of the ideal location and surroundings to make a video stand out in the vast online market. A simple way out is to use software-based simulation, which means replacing the video background with the required one rather than the original.

There is no two way about the fact that this app is the new kid in town. It is highly popular among the younger generation.</p><p>If you are a new TikToker, you need an introduction video. This has to be engaging enough to attract more and more followers. The primary aim of an introduction video is to say high to your followers and tell them about yourself. With this video, they will get to know you better.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Upload a Video to TikTok from Mac or PC&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone-3"><a href="#Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone-3" class="headerlink" title="Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)"></a>Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)</h2><p>In case you are all set to create a Tiktok intro video, here are a few tips you need to follow.</p><p>• Including Audio</p><p>At the top of the screen, you will find the option ‘Sound’. This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.</p><p>At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.</p><p>In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.</p><p>• Working with the Text</p><p>For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.</p><p>• Adding Effects</p><p>Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.</p><p>Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. <strong>The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos</strong> so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone.

TikTok is a passive pastime for the majority of us. You don’t have to hunt for videos; they find you as you <strong>accidentally refreshed TikTok</strong>. If you’ve ever attempted to use the search function to discover anything other than a particular author, you’ve probably had a difficult time. On your “For You” tab, you’ll sometimes see a video that sticks out from the others. It’s difficult to discover it again if you forgot to like it or accidentally refreshed your “For You” page.

This filter only displays search results for videos you’ve seen, which is a mind-boggling choice if you’re like me. I had no idea TikTok was keeping track of such videos. When you applied the filter, though, my video was the first to appear.

You should now see TikTok content from the people you’ve selected to follow. You’ll find it on the for you tab if you’re seeking material from folks you haven’t followed yet (FYP). The for you page is ideal if you want to lose yourself in hours of material. All you have to do is swipe, and fresh stuff will display on your screen. You can also favorite any video by long-pressing it or clicking the share symbol and then “Add to Favorites.” By selecting the “Bookmark” symbol in the profile area, you may access all of your favorite videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/what-if-i-accidentally-refreshed-tiktok-5.jpg"                      alt="Add to Favorites"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Refresh-TikTok-Manually"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Refresh-TikTok-Manually" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Use the search box at the top of the Discover tab to seek subjects you’re interested in. TikTok gave me all the top videos for “Science” when I initially put it into the search field. I could have browsed through the choices for users, hashtags, and more if I wanted to learn more.</p><p>This strategy is a simple way to locate a range of videos with distinct hashtags and music, as opposed to looking at popular sounds and themes.

Unfortunately, it seems that this is a TikTok-related mistake. If you’re new to TikTok and haven’t yet followed someone, you’re probably seeking someone to watch. When you initially start, the trending creator’s page displays a large number of celebrities for you to check out. This is offered to assist new users to have a better understanding of TikTok and how it works while they get their bearings. If you’re not a new user, though, this should not show instead on the next page. Instead of seeing their material when you follow creators, you should see their content.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There is no time restriction on how long this block will persist, however, it will depend on how many times this issue happens. If you make a mistake, the error should go fast. Because of the large number of videos submitted, they must automate this procedure, which often results in errors. After you find that ‘<strong>I was watching a TikTok and accidentally refreshed</strong>’ then with this guide, you may easily retrieve your videos from your TikTok profile page. Finally, try searching for one or two of these exact terms if you’re looking for a certain video and recall anything about its captioning. This will display all of the movies you’ve seen in the last seven days that have this term in the text, making it quicker to browse through while looking for a certain video.

You can also favorite any video by long-pressing it or clicking the share symbol and then “Add to Favorites.” By selecting the “Bookmark” symbol in the profile area, you may access all of your favorite videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/what-if-i-accidentally-refreshed-tiktok-5.jpg"                      alt="Add to Favorites"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Refresh-TikTok-Manually-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Refresh-TikTok-Manually-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How to Refresh TikTok Manually?</h2><p>When you first open your TikTok app, you’ll be sent to the For You tab, which is a page that is specifically created for each user to watch videos based on their previous activity. Use the search box at the top of the Discover tab to seek subjects you’re interested in. TikTok gave me all the top videos for “Science” when I initially put it into the search field. I could have browsed through the choices for users, hashtags, and more if I wanted to learn more.</p><p>This strategy is a simple way to locate a range of videos with distinct hashtags and music, as opposed to looking at popular sounds and themes. Following the makers and like the videos (by clicking the heart-shaped “like” icon on the side).</p><ul><li>To do so, browse down your stream for videos that interest you, and when you find one that you like, like it and go on to the next.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/what-if-i-accidentally-refreshed-tiktok-6.jpg"                      alt="For You"                ></p><ul><li>When you encounter a sort of video that you don’t want to view again, press down on the screen until a little menu appears with the option to choose ‘Not interested.’ To go to the next video, choose this option.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/what-if-i-accidentally-refreshed-tiktok-7.jpg"                      alt="Not Interested"                ></p><ul><li>You may also hide videos you don’t want to watch in the future by using the ‘More &gt;’ setting next to ‘Not interested.’</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/what-if-i-accidentally-refreshed-tiktok-8.jpg"                      alt="Not Interested"                ></p><p>The problem of TikTok not updating the follower’s page has been plaguing users for quite some time. Unfortunately, it seems that this is a TikTok-related mistake. If you’re new to TikTok and haven’t yet followed someone, you’re probably seeking someone to watch. When you initially start, the trending creator’s page displays a large number of celebrities for you to check out. This is offered to assist new users to have a better understanding of TikTok and how it works while they get their bearings. If you’re not a new user, though, this should not show instead on the next page. Instead of seeing their material when you follow creators, you should see their content.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There is no time restriction on how long this block will persist, however, it will depend on how many times this issue happens. If you make a mistake, the error should go fast. Because of the large number of videos submitted, they must automate this procedure, which often results in errors. After you find that ‘<strong>I was watching a TikTok and accidentally refreshed</strong>’ then with this guide, you may easily retrieve your videos from your TikTok profile page. Finally, try searching for one or two of these exact terms if you’re looking for a certain video and recall anything about its captioning. This will display all of the movies you’ve seen in the last seven days that have this term in the text, making it quicker to browse through while looking for a certain video. You may use the approaches mentioned above to get close to your objective.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-achieve-creative-excellence-on-tiktok-with-easy-border-swapping-strategies-for-2024/"><u>[New] Achieve Creative Excellence on TikTok with Easy Border Swapping Strategies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-entering-a-friends-tiktok-live-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[New] Entering a Friend's TikTok Live  A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-boost-engagement-and-growth-unlocking-youtube-analytics-via-social-blade/"><u>[New] In 2024, Boost Engagement and Growth -

When we talk about ease of use, we refer to the option of directly uploading a video on your TikTok profile from Mac.</p><p>The best thing about TikTok on Mac is that it has made it fairly easy for anyone to use their platform. If you want to upload a video to TikTok on Mac OS you will find it a child’s play. TikTok has a website version of the platform for people to use if they are on their computer.</p><ol><li><p>You should choose a video that has already been editing by video editing software as the website will not allow you to make any edits. We always emphasize using only the best video editor for Mac.</p></li><li><p>Go to Safari and search for the website of TikTok.</p></li><li><p>Once you are on there, you will need to Log in to your account by clicking on the button that appears on the top right corner of the window.</p></li><li><p>After you are in, you need to locate and click on the Cloud icon which will open a window for you to upload your video.</p></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/cloud-icon.jpg"                                     ></p><ol start="5"><li><p>Once the video is uploaded, you will be asked to put in a caption. We advise you to keep the caption quirky and fun. Another quick tip is that you should use hashtags that are trending at the moment as that will increase the visual appearance of your video more.</p></li><li><p>Time to choose a cover! Drag the frame to any part of the video to choose the thumbnail that you want as the cover of your content.</p></li></ol><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Upload-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="Upload tiktok video"                ></p><ol start="7"><li><p>Lastly, choose the audience of the video according to your preference in the same window.</p></li><li><p>Your video is ready to be uploaded and all you need to do now is to click on the Upload button that is on the bottom right of the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h2 id="Methods-of-Uploading-Videos-to-TikTok-on-Windows"><a href="#Methods-of-Uploading-Videos-to-TikTok-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Windows"></a>Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Windows</h2><p>As a person who does not own a Mac, you might be wondering if this article is for you or not. From this point onwards, the method will be for people who have a PC. To upload a video to TikTok from a PC, you can follow the same steps as above.</p><p>Believe it or not, the simplest way to upload videos to TikTok on Windows is the one that we have described in detail above. Of course, you will need to remember to edit the videos beforehand with the assistance of Tiktok video editing software.</p><p>If you wish to up your game and follow the best method and not the simplest one then we have something for you. The answer for many TikTok users is an android emulator. It is a sort of an application that behaves like an android device on your PC. It can be downloaded directly on Windows and used from your computer.</p><p>The benefit is that it will allow you to use the application version of TikTok which will allow you to edit the video just like you do on your smartphone.</p><p>You can use any Android emulator but we will advise you to use Bluestacks.

It capitalized on people’s shortened attention spans and focused on short-form videos to provide entertainment. Also, it provided people with an easy road to fame and with a solid side hustle.</p><p>Are you one of those who aspire to be TikTok’s future top-earner? Try making videos using <strong>TikTok video templates</strong>! They’ll allow you to churn out high-quality content faster than the competition. In this article, you will learn more about TikTok videos. Furthermore, we’ll introduce you to the 5 best places from where you can find great TikTok video templates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-video-template.gif"                      alt="use templates to create tiktok videos"                ></p><p>Get a Knowledge of TikTok Videos</p><p>TikTok videos are short-form content. They can be up to 3 minutes in length. And that is their charm. Busy people looking for “bite-sized” content turn to this platform for entertainment.</p><p>The TikTok videos that become successful include filters, effects, stickers, voiceovers, and background music. They can be about different topics, so anyone can make them.</p><p>An important thing creators should know is the dimension of videos. TikTok videos are made for mobile viewing (though you can watch them using the web app). So, videos are in portrait. That said, the recommended video size is 1080 x 1920 with a 9:16 aspect ratio.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Use-Templates-To-Make-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Why-Use-Templates-To-Make-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Templates To Make TikTok Videos?"></a>Why Use Templates To Make TikTok Videos?</h2><p>The competition on TikTok is tough.

You would not get into legal trouble unless you did something they do not allow, like making identifiable people appear in a bad light.</p><p>The catch is that Pexels is only a website where you can find and download stock resources. It does not provide you with any editing tools. Therefore, it’s only a good choice if you already have a trusty editor.

But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!</p><p>The reason?</p><p>Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!</p><p>This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.</p><p>So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?</p><p>To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.</p><p>And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.</p><h2 id="Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright"><a href="#Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?"></a><strong>Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?</strong></h2><p>To avoid getting banned!</p><p>You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.</p><p>The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.</p><p>If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.</p><p>To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.</p><p>But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?</p><p>Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading"><a href="#Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading" class="headerlink" title="Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading"></a><strong>Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading</strong></h2><p>Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it.

It contains all about TikTok Anime ideas; dances, songs, memes, and filters. Let’s find out one-by-one:</p><h3 id="Let’s-Groove"><a href="#Let’s-Groove" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Groove:"></a>Let’s Groove:</h3><p>This is another one of those TikTok trends where individuals show off their talents by dancing to trendy songs or music, which in this instance is a song called “Lets Groove” by an American band named “Earth Wind &amp; Fire“. This trend began when TikToker @absolutesnacc used a remix of Lets Groove to build a fan edit montage incorporating footage of actor Jason Segel from the TV program named “Freaks and Geeks”.</p><h3 id="Trending-dances"><a href="#Trending-dances" class="headerlink" title="Trending dances:"></a>Trending dances:</h3><p>TikTok is recognized for artists who know their movements — and in reality, many of the highest-earning TikTokers are dancers. But due to trendy dances, you don’t have to be an expert to perform the correct choreography. TikTok dances are generally short, pleasant, and entry-level, so amateurs may learn them with minimal effort. This offers a lot of flexibility for putting your twist on it—for example, ripping up the floor in a giant teddy bear costume.</p><h3 id="Prada-Bucket-challenge"><a href="#Prada-Bucket-challenge" class="headerlink" title="Prada Bucket challenge:"></a>Prada Bucket challenge:</h3><p>This TikTok fad is particular to the richer portion of the community, as artists join in this challenge to flaunt their costly attire when sporting a 600$ Prada Bucket hat, thus the name “Prada Bucket challenge”. Participants start by pretending to be “upset” about something, so they put their Prada Bucket hats on, and with some film editing magic, their clothing converts into more costly clothes.</p><h3 id="Glow-ups"><a href="#Glow-ups" class="headerlink" title="Glow-ups:"></a>Glow-ups:</h3><p>At its essence, a glow-up on TikTok is a “before” and “after.” Many artists may submit a few photographs or films depicting themselves as an awkward adolescent, then a last, contemporary clip. Glow-ups also work excellent for encouraging positive interaction. (Usually, one when they appear confident and amazing). These sorts of TikToks are wonderful for the wait-for-it factor: consumers are more willing to watch the complete video to see the finished product.</p><h3 id="Anime-Edits"><a href="#Anime-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Anime Edits:"></a>Anime Edits:</h3><p>If you’re an anime geek you’ve probably already heard about this trend when producers build a montage utilizing clips from their favorite anime series and add some background music simply to liven things up. Although this trend has been going on for a long now, it still doesn’t seem old since the anime fans have been keeping it alive. So, it doesn’t matter whether you enjoy Initial D or Naruto, this trend is relevant to all anime viewers.</p><h3 id="Edgy-humor"><a href="#Edgy-humor" class="headerlink" title="Edgy humor:"></a>Edgy humor:</h3><p>There’s a reason why TikTok is so popular with the under-30 crowd: the brief videos and highly scrollable characteristics of the app make it excellent for comedy, snark, and sass. And although many content producers and skilled social media marketers have discovered ways to convert TikTok into a business, the platform’s core aim is to “inspire creativity and generate joy.” So don’t take it too seriously. The edgier, the better.</p><h3 id="Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family"><a href="#Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family" class="headerlink" title="Making TikToks with Your Family:"></a>Making TikToks with Your Family:</h3><p>This goes hand in hand with being vulnerable and genuine—there’s nothing quite like a nice cameo from Mom, Dad, Grandma, or Grandpa. Because so many TikTok producers are millennials or Gen Z, it’s refreshing (and enjoyable) to see older folks on the platform. The difficult part of this is encouraging your family to join, but if you’ve got one excellent sport, you’ve hit gold. For example, simply try to watch this family dancing blooper without your heartbreak.</p><h3 id="Baked-Feta-Pasta"><a href="#Baked-Feta-Pasta" class="headerlink" title="Baked Feta Pasta:"></a>Baked Feta Pasta:</h3><p>This is a TikTok trend for all those foodies out there who enjoy delicious spaghetti with some cheese. This practice grew so prevalent that the grocery shops in Finland faced a scarcity of feta cheese. The technique of creating this pasta is straightforward, start by adding some cherry tomatoes and garlic in an oven-safe dish, sprinkle some salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, and pour some olive oil before combining the ingredients. Place a block of Feta cheese in the middle and bake in the oven until soft, compress the contents to make a paste, and combine with your favorite Pasta, that’s it! Your Baked Feta Pasta is ready to be served.</p><h3 id="Seamless-Transitions"><a href="#Seamless-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Seamless Transitions:"></a>Seamless Transitions:</h3><p>Another aspect that’s unique to TikTok is the transitions inside movies. The in-app editing tools make it simple to flip from one clip to another in a manner that appears like magic. This might be as basic as keeping your illumination the same and maintaining your camera in the same location. They may also be more sophisticated. Think spinning your camera about, putting your phone on the ground, zooming in and out – honestly, the sky’s the limit. When someone truly nails a transition, it’s virtually hard to view the video just once.</p><h3 id="Pet-Painting"><a href="#Pet-Painting" class="headerlink" title="Pet Painting:"></a>Pet Painting:</h3><p>This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to have your fuzzy companion included in one of your videos. No, you don’t paint a portrait of your pet, your pet performs the painting portion, how you may ask? it’s fairly easy, all you need is a canvas, some liquid colors of your choosing, a huge plastic bag, and a pet, of course, you will also need a paste-like food that your pet enjoys, peanut butter for instance. Start by covering the canvas with the plastic bag and spread peanut butter on the section covering the canvas, gently remove the canvas from the bag and keep the plastic aside.</p><h3 id="Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture"><a href="#Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Referencing Modern Pop Culture:"></a>Referencing Modern Pop Culture:</h3><p>Score some likes, comments, and shares by tapping into an already-huge fan following.

The way these trend works is really simple, you just call out your friend by making funny comments about certain bad habits or characteristics they have and then pass the phone to them because it’s their turn to do the same, so it’s just a series of taking turns roasting your friends and the best part is that there is no limit to how many people can participate.</p><h3 id="Challenge-Freezing-Honey"><a href="#Challenge-Freezing-Honey" class="headerlink" title="Challenge: Freezing Honey"></a>Challenge: Freezing Honey</h3><p>Another TikTok food craze is gaining traction, and it’s safe to assume that Honey is involved. One of the easiest fads to adopt is the freezing honey TikTok craze; everyone has honey and, of course, a freezer. This challenge calls for 100 percent pure honey, since non-pure honey may crystallize at low temperatures. If your honey comes in a plastic bottle, chuck it in the freezer; if it comes in a jar, pour it into a plastic container and remove any lids or bottle tops before freezing, since these may be difficult to remove after freezing.</p><h3 id="Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life"><a href="#Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life" class="headerlink" title="Documenting a Day in The Life:"></a>Documenting a Day in The Life:</h3><p>While grumpy Instagram users may tell you that “no one wants to see your avocado toast,” the truth is that a lot of people do. Many of these films romanticize the mundane, but humor has a place in this medium as well. If you’re a creative who gets a lot of questions in the comments section, here is the place to be. Seeing someone’s daily routine, whether it’s a second-grade teacher, a lawyer, or a couple living in a van, is a rewarding experience. Over 2 million people have liked this “actual day in the life of a vehicle.”</p><h3 id="Classical-Challenges"><a href="#Classical-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Classical Challenges:"></a>Classical Challenges:</h3><p>TikTok thrives on obstacles. For challenges, many TikTok users would all post films aiming to achieve the same thing, like the stair-step challenge, where they would dance up a set of steps in intricate ways. These are generally community-created trends; however, they may take the shape of sponsored hashtags, too. Challenges are a simple way for users on TikTok to feel like they’re part of the community.</p><h3 id="Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me"><a href="#Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me" class="headerlink" title="Tell Me Without Telling Me:"></a>Tell Me Without Telling Me:</h3><p>The creator begins by saying, “Tell me you drive a fast car without telling me you drive a fast car” and then says, “I’ll go first” to start a streak for other users to follow. Users then proceed to show the engine layout of their vehicle, the exhaust note, or possibly a flyby, so following this trend is a good way to make your TikToks stand out. This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to tell your audience what you’re trying to say or to depict certain occurrences subtly.</p><h3 id="Behind-the-scenes-Videos"><a href="#Behind-the-scenes-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Behind-the-scenes Videos:"></a>Behind-the-scenes Videos:</h3><p>We love an inside scoop, and behind-the-scenes films are perfect for teaching and for making viewers feel like they’re receiving something special. If you’re a creative who generates something tangible (like art, cuisine, or fashion) and advertises it on TikTok, a behind-the-scenes film might give your brand an added depth. You can even produce a behind-the-scenes TikTok describing how you made a TikTok. Ontario, California-based Logan’s candies attracted five and a half million followers by releasing TikToks depicting how their sweets were made—it’s a very interesting process.</p><h3 id="Love-Nwantiti-Dance"><a href="#Love-Nwantiti-Dance" class="headerlink" title="Love Nwantiti Dance:"></a>Love Nwantiti Dance:</h3><p>The Love Nwantiti Dance is a dance that is performed by people who love one another.

This is one of those TikTok trends where content producers flash their skills by dancing to hot music or songs, in this instance a tune named “Love Nwantiti.” It is more popular with young people.</p><h3 id="Hashtags-with-Challenges"><a href="#Hashtags-with-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Hashtags with Challenges:"></a>Hashtags with Challenges:</h3><p>Many videos will frequently add a #ForYou hashtag to be featured on the page. Just like any other app, getting to the main page is key to landing a popular TikTok video and collecting new followers. Considering TikTok is starting to look at advertising directly in the app, revenue for TikTokers isn’t far off, and leveraging hashtags to trick the system is important to gaining viewers. TikTok virtually runs on hashtags. It’s what makes the app so entertaining. Everything is shared, and everyone is encouraged to join in. Clicking on hashtags, particularly ones that are developed around challenges, is a simple method to find what others are using to get to the ‘For You’ area.</p><h3 id="Learn-on-TikTok"><a href="#Learn-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Learn on TikTok:"></a>Learn on TikTok:</h3><p>This TikTok trend is a spectacular method for creators to share their ideas, talents, and life hacks and a chance for viewers to expand their knowledge on particular subjects and discover new items that may aid them in their day-to-day lives. The greatest part is that this trend is for everyone since the number of concepts that may be inferred here is practically never-ending, there might be someone excellent at cooking, someone, whose fighting abilities are good, someone who’s strong at arithmetic, or maybe someone who’s good at mending automobiles.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>From ramping up your posting schedule to taking part in challenges, and optimizing your hashtags, the inventive methods to get followers and develop a TikTok community are numerous. Regardless, if you find <strong>anime TikTok</strong> cringeworthy and strange, that’s probably because you grew up in the period before the social web. Generation Z’s enjoy the funny internet sharing platform and many now earn money from it. It’s easy, hilarious, and irreverent - and a pleasant change of pace from more serious networks such as Twitter and Facebook. It’s the perfect procrastination app that can lure you in for hours. Ultimately, the greatest strategy to expand your following will come down to your ingenuity, so don’t hold back and start experimenting with the <strong>TikTok anime</strong> videos you’ve always wanted to do.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins

The “Green Screen Duet Feature.” This feature also lets users apply another person’s video as the background.</p><p>Green screens were once only available to those who had access to, well, a green screen. Now the case is different. You can utilize this “Green Screen” feature from the various applications now, allowing you to add a customizable background to your video, and TikTok is one of them. s Various content creators customize their background with effects, a still image, or even a video from their camera roll using the TikTok app.</p><p>Imagine scrolling down the TikTok app and finding an eye-catching customized background.

Either navigate the video with a green screen effect or type <strong>Green Screen</strong> in the <strong>Search Box</strong> to find a video. Open the video and click on the Green Screen Effect in the bottom left of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-green-screen-effect-from-others-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="get green screen effects from others in TikTok"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Make Your Video with the Green Screen Effect</strong></p><p>Now, you can record your TikTok video with the green-screen effect used.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-TikTok-Video-Background-without-Green-Screen-in-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-TikTok-Video-Background-without-Green-Screen-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change TikTok Video Background without Green Screen in Filmora?"></a>Part 3: How to Change TikTok Video Background without Green Screen in Filmora?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most popular video editing software among YouTubers.

It needs a very few mouse clicks, and it works the best when there are people next to the camera.</p><p>After you’ve eliminated the background, you’ll be able to see the primary foreground of your video in live time. You can then supplement your actual video with a picture or a background. You can also use the video without the background as an intermediate layer on top of another video.

It is a Japanese manga series that got a lot of fame recently. A massive fan of anime might recognize the anime series for its intriguing fight sequences. Recently we have seen a huge trend of Jujutsu Kaisen videos on TikTok where she says “Anime is Trash,” and suddenly the scene turns into an anime fight scene. Technically, this is the filming term “jump cut.” You would likely want to create your own of these videos after watching them.</p><p>If you are one of the Jujutsu Kaisen fans and looking to create your TikTok montage, then you just landed on the right page. You can easily make such videos by using a video editor like Filmora X. In this article, we will walk through the steps involved in creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok montage videos. Now you can create your own scenes and connect them with Jutusu Kaisen fight scenes. Trust me, this is so much fun while editing it.</p><h2 id="Step-By-Step-Guide-For-Creating-Jujutsu-Kaisen-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Step-By-Step-Guide-For-Creating-Jujutsu-Kaisen-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos"></a><strong>Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos</strong></h2><p>It requires two things to produce such videos. First, you need an idea for making the first part of the video, where you are engaged in some type of activity, or the video involves some kind of interaction with others. Second, you need a clip from the anime that goes along with the first part of the video and justifies the action you perform in the first part of the video. You can create these videos in three simple steps.</p><hr><hr><h4 id="Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet"><a href="#Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet"></a>Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet</h4><p>The first thing you need is the anime footage that you want to use in your video. There are plenty of scenes that you can create, but you have to choose wisely. You can search on the internet, and you will find plenty of websites from where you can download these anime videos. The best exercise for selecting the video clip is, keep watching videos and if you find something interesting, download that clip.</p><h4 id="Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip"><a href="#Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip"></a>Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip</h4><p>Once you have selected a clip from the anime series, you have to make your own video that matches the scene you selected from the anime video. If there are two characters in anime, then you may also need two characters to make your own video. In TikTok videos, you may have seen two characters with a girl saying “Anime is trash” and a boy punching her, and then abruptly, the scene changes to Jujutsu Kaisen fight scene.</p><p>The punching scene is just an example, but you can come up with your own creative scenes that you can connect with anime clips and make interesting videos. Make sure to keep some points in your mind when shooting video,</p><ul><li>Keep the camera stable and make sure there are no shakes in your video. You can use a tripod for this purpose or fix your camera somewhere to keep it stable. Avoid recording video by holding the camera in your hand.</li><li>The video angle should be correct, and it should be according to the anime footage. For example, if the punching person is on the right side of anime footage, you should follow the same sequence.</li><li>It is recommended that the video be shot in sufficient natural light, but artificial lights may also be used.</li><li>It is crucial to use a high-quality camera when making videos. You can do this with a smartphone or camera, and you should make sure you are filming in 1080p. Low-quality video will not perform well.</li></ul><h4 id="Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips"><a href="#Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips"></a>Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips</h4><p>Once you have both video clips, the next step is editing the video and joining them to create a fantastic scene. For this purpose, we will use the Filmora X video editing software, which is both easy to use and one of the best video editing programs. To edit your videos, follow the steps given below:</p><ol><li>Download Filmora X video editor from their official website, install it on your computer if it is already installed, and then run the program to start video editing.</li><li>Go to file, and click on import media and then click on import media files.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu1.png"                      alt="jujutsu1"                ></li><li>Now select both clips and import them to Filmora X.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu2.png"                      alt="jujutsu2"                ></li><li>Drag and drop your own video and bring it to the first track. Then drag and drop the anime video and place it next to your video in the track.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu3.png"                      alt="jujutsu3"                ></li><li>You may need to make some adjustments to both video clips so that the scenes perfectly match each other. The most important step in creating videos matches the sound where a person says, “Anime is trash,” and then the action happens.</li><li>Play the video to make sure everything is in position. If you feel that it still requires adjusting, then go back to the previous step and make the needed adjustments.</li><li>Music is critical to match to make the video looks smooth. Find your music to make them fit perfectly. For example, matching the hard beat with the punch or turning up the volume when the anime shows would be good ideas.</li><li>Once everything is perfectly aligned, your video is ready, and now you need to export it.</li><li>Click on the export button and select the desired video format from the list, i.e. (MP4, Gif, WMV, FLV, etc.).<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu4.png"                      alt="jujutsu4"                ></li><li>Once you have selected the desired format, click on export, and the video will take some time to render. Once rendered, you can now share the video with your friends and wow them. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu5.gif"                      alt="jujutsu5"                ></li></ol><p>Conclusion: These are some simple steps using which you can create your own Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Montage. Now it’s up to you to create new ideas and make interesting videos. We recommend using the Filmora X video editor because it is easy to use and can do wonders for you. Even if you don’t have any prior experience in video editing, you can follow these steps and create amazing videos. It may take some time, but you will get better eventually.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><h5 id="Liza-Brown-1"><a href="#Liza-Brown-1" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Have you ever watched Jujutsu Kaisen?

Then drag and drop the anime video and place it next to your video in the track.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu3.png"                      alt="jujutsu3"                ></li><li>You may need to make some adjustments to both video clips so that the scenes perfectly match each other. The most important step in creating videos matches the sound where a person says, “Anime is trash,” and then the action happens.</li><li>Play the video to make sure everything is in position. If you feel that it still requires adjusting, then go back to the previous step and make the needed adjustments.</li><li>Music is critical to match to make the video looks smooth. Find your music to make them fit perfectly. For example, matching the hard beat with the punch or turning up the volume when the anime shows would be good ideas.</li><li>Once everything is perfectly aligned, your video is ready, and now you need to export it.</li><li>Click on the export button and select the desired video format from the list, i.e. (MP4, Gif, WMV, FLV, etc.).<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu4.png"                      alt="jujutsu4"                ></li><li>Once you have selected the desired format, click on export, and the video will take some time to render.

It is a Japanese manga series that got a lot of fame recently. A massive fan of anime might recognize the anime series for its intriguing fight sequences. Recently we have seen a huge trend of Jujutsu Kaisen videos on TikTok where she says “Anime is Trash,” and suddenly the scene turns into an anime fight scene. Technically, this is the filming term “jump cut.” You would likely want to create your own of these videos after watching them.</p><p>If you are one of the Jujutsu Kaisen fans and looking to create your TikTok montage, then you just landed on the right page. You can easily make such videos by using a video editor like Filmora X. In this article, we will walk through the steps involved in creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok montage videos. Now you can create your own scenes and connect them with Jutusu Kaisen fight scenes. Trust me, this is so much fun while editing it.</p><h2 id="Step-By-Step-Guide-For-Creating-Jujutsu-Kaisen-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Step-By-Step-Guide-For-Creating-Jujutsu-Kaisen-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos"></a><strong>Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos</strong></h2><p>It requires two things to produce such videos. First, you need an idea for making the first part of the video, where you are engaged in some type of activity, or the video involves some kind of interaction with others. Second, you need a clip from the anime that goes along with the first part of the video and justifies the action you perform in the first part of the video. You can create these videos in three simple steps.</p><hr><hr><h4 id="Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet"><a href="#Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet"></a>Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet</h4><p>The first thing you need is the anime footage that you want to use in your video. There are plenty of scenes that you can create, but you have to choose wisely. You can search on the internet, and you will find plenty of websites from where you can download these anime videos. The best exercise for selecting the video clip is, keep watching videos and if you find something interesting, download that clip.</p><h4 id="Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip"><a href="#Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip"></a>Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip</h4><p>Once you have selected a clip from the anime series, you have to make your own video that matches the scene you selected from the anime video. If there are two characters in anime, then you may also need two characters to make your own video. In TikTok videos, you may have seen two characters with a girl saying “Anime is trash” and a boy punching her, and then abruptly, the scene changes to Jujutsu Kaisen fight scene.</p><p>The punching scene is just an example, but you can come up with your own creative scenes that you can connect with anime clips and make interesting videos. Make sure to keep some points in your mind when shooting video,</p><ul><li>Keep the camera stable and make sure there are no shakes in your video. You can use a tripod for this purpose or fix your camera somewhere to keep it stable. Avoid recording video by holding the camera in your hand.</li><li>The video angle should be correct, and it should be according to the anime footage. For example, if the punching person is on the right side of anime footage, you should follow the same sequence.</li><li>It is recommended that the video be shot in sufficient natural light, but artificial lights may also be used.</li><li>It is crucial to use a high-quality camera when making videos. You can do this with a smartphone or camera, and you should make sure you are filming in 1080p. Low-quality video will not perform well.</li></ul><h4 id="Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips"><a href="#Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips"></a>Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips</h4><p>Once you have both video clips, the next step is editing the video and joining them to create a fantastic scene.

It is a Japanese manga series that got a lot of fame recently. A massive fan of anime might recognize the anime series for its intriguing fight sequences. Recently we have seen a huge trend of Jujutsu Kaisen videos on TikTok where she says “Anime is Trash,” and suddenly the scene turns into an anime fight scene. Technically, this is the filming term “jump cut.” You would likely want to create your own of these videos after watching them.</p><p>If you are one of the Jujutsu Kaisen fans and looking to create your TikTok montage, then you just landed on the right page. You can easily make such videos by using a video editor like Filmora X. In this article, we will walk through the steps involved in creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok montage videos. Now you can create your own scenes and connect them with Jutusu Kaisen fight scenes. Trust me, this is so much fun while editing it.</p><h2 id="Step-By-Step-Guide-For-Creating-Jujutsu-Kaisen-TikTok-Videos-1"><a href="#Step-By-Step-Guide-For-Creating-Jujutsu-Kaisen-TikTok-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos"></a><strong>Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos</strong></h2><p>It requires two things to produce such videos. First, you need an idea for making the first part of the video, where you are engaged in some type of activity, or the video involves some kind of interaction with others. Second, you need a clip from the anime that goes along with the first part of the video and justifies the action you perform in the first part of the video. You can create these videos in three simple steps.</p><hr><hr><h4 id="Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet-1"><a href="#Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet"></a>Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet</h4><p>The first thing you need is the anime footage that you want to use in your video. There are plenty of scenes that you can create, but you have to choose wisely. You can search on the internet, and you will find plenty of websites from where you can download these anime videos. The best exercise for selecting the video clip is, keep watching videos and if you find something interesting, download that clip.</p><h4 id="Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip-1"><a href="#Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip"></a>Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip</h4><p>Once you have selected a clip from the anime series, you have to make your own video that matches the scene you selected from the anime video. If there are two characters in anime, then you may also need two characters to make your own video. In TikTok videos, you may have seen two characters with a girl saying “Anime is trash” and a boy punching her, and then abruptly, the scene changes to Jujutsu Kaisen fight scene.</p><p>The punching scene is just an example, but you can come up with your own creative scenes that you can connect with anime clips and make interesting videos. Make sure to keep some points in your mind when shooting video,</p><ul><li>Keep the camera stable and make sure there are no shakes in your video. You can use a tripod for this purpose or fix your camera somewhere to keep it stable. Avoid recording video by holding the camera in your hand.</li><li>The video angle should be correct, and it should be according to the anime footage. For example, if the punching person is on the right side of anime footage, you should follow the same sequence.</li><li>It is recommended that the video be shot in sufficient natural light, but artificial lights may also be used.</li><li>It is crucial to use a high-quality camera when making videos. You can do this with a smartphone or camera, and you should make sure you are filming in 1080p. Low-quality video will not perform well.</li></ul><h4 id="Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips-1"><a href="#Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips"></a>Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips</h4><p>Once you have both video clips, the next step is editing the video and joining them to create a fantastic scene.

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out <strong>how to do Siri voice on TikTok</strong> without any hassle in the next part!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?"></a>Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</h2><p>To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps. Here are the steps that you need to take care of:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch TikTok on your mobile phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start recording a video; else, upload an already recorded video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Upload button and then click on the checkmark.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, begin writing something on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap on the text you have just written, and you will see the Text-to-Speech option.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Click on that and hear the automated voice reading your text. Now, upload the videos, and that’s it. All done!</p><h2 id="Part-3-Don’t-Like-the-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok-Try-These-TikTok-Voice-Changer-Apps"><a href="#Part-3-Don’t-Like-the-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok-Try-These-TikTok-Voice-Changer-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Don’t Like the Siri Voice on TikTok? Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps"></a>Part 3: Don’t Like the Siri Voice on TikTok? Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

The voice filters are unique, and the sharing options are excellent too. The drawback, though, it displays tons of ads, which can be pretty annoying.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Celebrity-Voice-Changer-Parody"><a href="#2-Celebrity-Voice-Changer-Parody" class="headerlink" title="2.

The program gives users a plethora of tools and alternatives to help them increase their creativity and originality when it comes to their material. It is possible to apply the Slow-motion effect to a video using one of the tools that TikTok gives to its users.</p><p>The slow-motion effect will slow down the pace of that specific area of the movie, which will significantly impact the overall quality of your content. Therefore, in this article, we have compiled a comprehensive guide that will show you the exact methods of making <strong>Slow Motion Tik Tok</strong> videos for your social content. Let’s get started!</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How to Record Tik Tok Video Wit Slow Motion Effects?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How o Add Slow-Mo Effects After Recording Videos on Tik Tok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Slow Down Tik Tok Videos Online for Free?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How to Slow TikTok Video And Song Using Filmora?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-Tik-Tok-Video-Wit-Slow-Motion-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-Tik-Tok-Video-Wit-Slow-Motion-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Record Tik Tok Video Wit Slow Motion Effects?"></a>Part 1: How to Record Tik Tok Video Wit Slow Motion Effects?</h2><p>TikTok videos may benefit from adding effects, which is a simple process. You may do it during the recording process or after the fact in post-production. One viral effect is slow-motion. You can use this to create some quite amusing videos, particularly when combined with other effects.</p><p>In this section, we’ll go through how to record a TikTok video with the slow-mo effect.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The first step is to <strong>Open Tik Tok</strong>, which can be accomplished by searching for the program on your smartphone. When you first launch TikTok, it will open in the feed area by default, as seen below. Navigation to the new video screen requires one press on the <strong>+ symbol</strong> at the bottom of your screen, as seen in the image below before it will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-record-video-button.jpg"                      alt="tiktok record video button"                ></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You will be taken to the recording area, where your phone’s camera will be launched immediately.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you first access the new video area, a bar displaying the various recording speeds displays, as seen in the screenshot below. It is necessary to pick the slowest feasible speed.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> You may also select the video’s pace based on your preferences and how sluggish you want to make the movie seem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-video-recording-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="tiktok video recording speed option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next to selecting the desired speed, you must go to the following screen. It is possible to see a <strong>Check Mark</strong> option appear in the right-hand corner of the screen, as seen in the illustration. Tap on it once to advance to the next stage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/confirm-tiktok-recording-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="confirm tiktok recording speed option"                ></p><p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>4:</strong> Then, go to the next step after selecting the desired speed. As seen below, you must record the video by <strong>Tapping and Holding the Red Color Record button</strong> for some time.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Once the video has been recorded and is in a slower speed, it will automatically be recorded in slow motion. You can use this method to record your TikTok videos with a slow-motion effect.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-o-Add-Slow-Mo-Effects-After-Recording-Videos-on-Tik-Tok"><a href="#Part-2-How-o-Add-Slow-Mo-Effects-After-Recording-Videos-on-Tik-Tok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How o Add Slow-Mo Effects After Recording Videos on Tik Tok?"></a>Part 2: How o Add Slow-Mo Effects After Recording Videos on Tik Tok?</h2><p>What about the videos you have already recorded on your TikTok application? Can you slow them down too? The following steps illustrate how to apply a slow-motion effect to your TikTok videos once they have been recorded using the app.</p><p>It is simple to record a video by simply going to the “Add new” area and selecting the video of your choosing to record. When you’ve finished recording, choose the next choice from the drop-down menu. Following that, you may proceed with the procedure.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Once you’ve arrived at the next screen, you’ll need to click on the <strong>Circular clock</strong> symbol to activate the effect. It is located in the bottom left corner of the screen, as seen below.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> To access it, click on it. To access the effects, tap on it once. The effects under the <strong>Filter</strong> effects section will be immediately activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-special-effects-option.jpg"                      alt="tiktok special effects option"                ></p><p>Step 2: To use this feature, you must browse the Time Effects part of the effects section. To do so, choose “<strong>Time effects</strong>“ from the drop-down menu in the bottom right corner of the screen, as shown by the arrow in the image below. It will provide you with different temporal effects.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872496/14483" target="_top" id="1872496"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872496"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="625"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872496/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-time-effects-option.jpg"                      alt="tiktok time effects option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> It is necessary to choose the <strong>Slow Motion</strong> option from the list of alternatives that appears, as shown in the figure below. This will give the video the appearance of being in slow motion.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: Changing the length of the slow-motion is accomplished by dragging the green square that appears on the screen. <strong>Drag it</strong> to any portion of the page where you want the slow-motion effect to appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-slow-motion-effect.jpg"                      alt="tiktok slow motion effect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’re pleased with the effect, you may save it by selecting the save option from the menu. As seen in the illustration below, click on “<strong>Save</strong>“ will save your work.</p><p><strong>(Note</strong>: You will be returned to the previous screen if you do so. After that, you may edit it with whatever filters you want and publish it just like any other video).</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Slow-Down-Tik-Tok-Videos-Online-for-Free"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Slow-Down-Tik-Tok-Videos-Online-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Slow Down Tik Tok Videos Online for Free?"></a>Part 3: How to Slow Down Tik Tok Videos Online for Free?</h2><h3 id="Kapwing"><a href="#Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="Kapwing"></a>Kapwing</h3><p>In a couple of seconds, Kapwing can speed up and slow down short videos. Slo-mo, timelapse, and hyperspeed films may be made with no editing skills then shared on social networking websites like YouTube.</p><p>Get started by uploading a video or pasting a URL. AVI, MP4, MOV, and 3PG are all supported formats by Kapwing. As slow as 0.25x for a slow-motion movie and as much as 4x for an enhanced video are available. Let’s give you a step-by-step illustration:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On TikTok, find the video you want to slow down and click on. You have the option of slowing down videos from other people’s profiles and those from your profile. <strong>Copy the URL</strong> that appears when you click the <strong>Share</strong> button.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> This is where Kapwing comes in, and we utilize it on our PC using Chrome to accomplish our objective. Visit <a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/" >https://www.kapwing.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and copy the URL of the TikTok video and paste it into Kapwing.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to the Speed section, and use the – and + buttons to make the video slow down or speed up. After selecting “<strong>slow-motion</strong>“ as your preferred speed, press the “<strong>play</strong>“ button to begin watching the movie. If the video moves too slowly, click on the <strong>Plus</strong> sign and keep rewatching it until you’re satisfied with the pace.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-slow-motion-effect-kapwing-online.jpg"                      alt="add slow motion effect kapwing online"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This step is optional, but it comes in useful if you’re performing in a duet or if you want to watch a TikTok video while you’re not connected to the internet. Following your completion of the speed adjustment, go to the top of the studio and click <strong>Export</strong> <strong>Video</strong>. After your video has been processed, you may save it to your device by clicking the <strong>Download</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-or-share-looping-video-interface-kapwing.jpg"                      alt="download or share looping video interface kapwing"                ></p><p><em>For more detail, you can check this article:</em> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>How to make a slo-mo video with Kapwing</em></a> <em>?</em></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Slow-TikTok-Video-And-Song-Using-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Slow-TikTok-Video-And-Song-Using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Slow TikTok Video And Song Using Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to Slow TikTok Video And Song Using Filmora?</h2><p>In principle, TikTok can meet the majority of users’ video creation, editing, and sharing requirements.
