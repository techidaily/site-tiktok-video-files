TikTok is a passive pastime for the majority of us. You don’t have to hunt for videos; they find you as you <strong>accidentally refreshed TikTok</strong>. If you’ve ever attempted to use the search function to discover anything other than a particular author, you’ve probably had a difficult time. On your “For You” tab, you’ll sometimes see a video that sticks out from the others. It’s difficult to discover it again if you forgot to like it or accidentally refreshed your “For You” page. There are just too many videos on the site for you to have a chance of finding one in particular, particularly if the video is related to a popular subject.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Find-Videos-You-Have-Seen-When-Accidentally-Refreshed"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Find-Videos-You-Have-Seen-When-Accidentally-Refreshed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

But it is; there is no greater annoyance than watching a video and then unintentionally refreshing your feed and seeing it go forever. So, <strong>what to do if you accidentally refreshed TikTok</strong>? Let’s find out the solutions available here.

The product, known as the Ultrastar Transporter, is a new Western Digital-built travel case that houses a whopping 368TB of NVMe flash storage. The case is TAA compliant and has a 12-core Intel Ice Lake server that houses all SSDs and dual 200Gb ethernet ports.</p><p> The Ultrastar Transporter briefcase addresses high-performance, high-capacity data transfers between server and edge locations. Western Digital reports that demand is high for physical storage transport, particularly vast amounts of data that would take days or weeks to transfer over the Internet. WD’s new travel case solves this problem by allowing users to transport vast data through good old physical transportation.</p><p> Image 1 of 2</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Western Digital Ultrastar Transporter"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Western Digital)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Western Digital Ultrastar Transporter"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Western Digital)</p><p> A few examples include workloads where high-capacity data capture needs to be processed at one location from another. Another is the proliferation of multi-datacenter workflows, where large data sets have to be held at multiple locations and rapidly sent to those locations faster than what raw internet bandwidth can provide.</p><p> The Ultrastar Transporter has a rackmount server that holds all 368TB of NVMe flash storage to accommodate all that storage. The server features a 12-core Intel<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-10nm-ice-lake-test-benchmarks,6257.html" >Ice Lake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Xeon 4310 CPU, 128GB of DDR4 RDIMM memory, 1300W Titanium PSU, and dual 2TB SN740 NVMe SSDs in Raid 1, which serve as the boot drive. I&#x2F;O consists of dual 200GB ethernet ports, dual USB 3.0 ports, a DB9 serial port, and a VGA port. 7 PCIe Gen4 slots are located on the board, including four x16 slots and three x8 slots. These PCIe slots connect all 368TB of SSD storage to the system.</p><p> The case itself looks like a conventional carrying case. The outer shell appears to be hard plastic, with metal supporting rails filling the lips of the case. The case features two latching mechanisms and a mechanism to attach a lock for<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security" >security <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

It is a Japanese manga series that got a lot of fame recently. A massive fan of anime might recognize the anime series for its intriguing fight sequences. Recently we have seen a huge trend of Jujutsu Kaisen videos on TikTok where she says “Anime is Trash,” and suddenly the scene turns into an anime fight scene. Technically, this is the filming term “jump cut.” You would likely want to create your own of these videos after watching them.</p><p>If you are one of the Jujutsu Kaisen fans and looking to create your TikTok montage, then you just landed on the right page. You can easily make such videos by using a video editor like Filmora X. In this article, we will walk through the steps involved in creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok montage videos. Now you can create your own scenes and connect them with Jutusu Kaisen fight scenes. Trust me, this is so much fun while editing it.</p><h2 id="Step-By-Step-Guide-For-Creating-Jujutsu-Kaisen-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Step-By-Step-Guide-For-Creating-Jujutsu-Kaisen-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos"></a><strong>Step By Step Guide For Creating Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Videos</strong></h2><p>It requires two things to produce such videos. First, you need an idea for making the first part of the video, where you are engaged in some type of activity, or the video involves some kind of interaction with others. Second, you need a clip from the anime that goes along with the first part of the video and justifies the action you perform in the first part of the video. You can create these videos in three simple steps.</p><hr><hr><h4 id="Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet"><a href="#Step1-Download-The-Anime-Clip-From-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet"></a>Step1: Download The Anime Clip From the Internet</h4><p>The first thing you need is the anime footage that you want to use in your video. There are plenty of scenes that you can create, but you have to choose wisely. You can search on the internet, and you will find plenty of websites from where you can download these anime videos. The best exercise for selecting the video clip is, keep watching videos and if you find something interesting, download that clip.</p><h4 id="Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip"><a href="#Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip"></a>Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip</h4><p>Once you have selected a clip from the anime series, you have to make your own video that matches the scene you selected from the anime video. If there are two characters in anime, then you may also need two characters to make your own video. In TikTok videos, you may have seen two characters with a girl saying “Anime is trash” and a boy punching her, and then abruptly, the scene changes to Jujutsu Kaisen fight scene.</p><p>The punching scene is just an example, but you can come up with your own creative scenes that you can connect with anime clips and make interesting videos. Make sure to keep some points in your mind when shooting video,</p><ul><li>Keep the camera stable and make sure there are no shakes in your video. You can use a tripod for this purpose or fix your camera somewhere to keep it stable. Avoid recording video by holding the camera in your hand.</li><li>The video angle should be correct, and it should be according to the anime footage. For example, if the punching person is on the right side of anime footage, you should follow the same sequence.</li><li>It is recommended that the video be shot in sufficient natural light, but artificial lights may also be used.</li><li>It is crucial to use a high-quality camera when making videos. You can do this with a smartphone or camera, and you should make sure you are filming in 1080p. Low-quality video will not perform well.</li></ul><h4 id="Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips"><a href="#Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips"></a>Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips</h4><p>Once you have both video clips, the next step is editing the video and joining them to create a fantastic scene. For this purpose, we will use the Filmora X video editing software, which is both easy to use and one of the best video editing programs. To edit your videos, follow the steps given below:</p><ol><li>Download Filmora X video editor from their official website, install it on your computer if it is already installed, and then run the program to start video editing.</li><li>Go to file, and click on import media and then click on import media files.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu1.png"                      alt="jujutsu1"                ></li><li>Now select both clips and import them to Filmora X.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu2.png"                      alt="jujutsu2"                ></li><li>Drag and drop your own video and bring it to the first track. Then drag and drop the anime video and place it next to your video in the track.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu3.png"                      alt="jujutsu3"                ></li><li>You may need to make some adjustments to both video clips so that the scenes perfectly match each other. The most important step in creating videos matches the sound where a person says, “Anime is trash,” and then the action happens.</li><li>Play the video to make sure everything is in position. If you feel that it still requires adjusting, then go back to the previous step and make the needed adjustments.</li><li>Music is critical to match to make the video looks smooth. Find your music to make them fit perfectly. For example, matching the hard beat with the punch or turning up the volume when the anime shows would be good ideas.</li><li>Once everything is perfectly aligned, your video is ready, and now you need to export it.</li><li>Click on the export button and select the desired video format from the list, i.e. (MP4, Gif, WMV, FLV, etc.).<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu4.png"                      alt="jujutsu4"                ></li><li>Once you have selected the desired format, click on export, and the video will take some time to render. Once rendered, you can now share the video with your friends and wow them. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu5.gif"                      alt="jujutsu5"                ></li></ol><p>Conclusion: These are some simple steps using which you can create your own Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Montage. Now it’s up to you to create new ideas and make interesting videos. We recommend using the Filmora X video editor because it is easy to use and can do wonders for you.

The best exercise for selecting the video clip is, keep watching videos and if you find something interesting, download that clip.</p><h4 id="Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip-1"><a href="#Step2-Shoot-Your-Own-Clip-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip"></a>Step2: Shoot Your Own Clip</h4><p>Once you have selected a clip from the anime series, you have to make your own video that matches the scene you selected from the anime video. If there are two characters in anime, then you may also need two characters to make your own video. In TikTok videos, you may have seen two characters with a girl saying “Anime is trash” and a boy punching her, and then abruptly, the scene changes to Jujutsu Kaisen fight scene.</p><p>The punching scene is just an example, but you can come up with your own creative scenes that you can connect with anime clips and make interesting videos. Make sure to keep some points in your mind when shooting video,</p><ul><li>Keep the camera stable and make sure there are no shakes in your video. You can use a tripod for this purpose or fix your camera somewhere to keep it stable. Avoid recording video by holding the camera in your hand.</li><li>The video angle should be correct, and it should be according to the anime footage. For example, if the punching person is on the right side of anime footage, you should follow the same sequence.</li><li>It is recommended that the video be shot in sufficient natural light, but artificial lights may also be used.</li><li>It is crucial to use a high-quality camera when making videos. You can do this with a smartphone or camera, and you should make sure you are filming in 1080p. Low-quality video will not perform well.</li></ul><h4 id="Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips-1"><a href="#Step3-Edit-and-Connect-both-Clips-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips"></a>Step3: Edit and Connect both Clips</h4><p>Once you have both video clips, the next step is editing the video and joining them to create a fantastic scene. For this purpose, we will use the Filmora X video editing software, which is both easy to use and one of the best video editing programs. To edit your videos, follow the steps given below:</p><ol><li>Download Filmora X video editor from their official website, install it on your computer if it is already installed, and then run the program to start video editing.</li><li>Go to file, and click on import media and then click on import media files.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu1.png"                      alt="jujutsu1"                ></li><li>Now select both clips and import them to Filmora X.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu2.png"                      alt="jujutsu2"                ></li><li>Drag and drop your own video and bring it to the first track. Then drag and drop the anime video and place it next to your video in the track.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu3.png"                      alt="jujutsu3"                ></li><li>You may need to make some adjustments to both video clips so that the scenes perfectly match each other. The most important step in creating videos matches the sound where a person says, “Anime is trash,” and then the action happens.</li><li>Play the video to make sure everything is in position. If you feel that it still requires adjusting, then go back to the previous step and make the needed adjustments.</li><li>Music is critical to match to make the video looks smooth. Find your music to make them fit perfectly. For example, matching the hard beat with the punch or turning up the volume when the anime shows would be good ideas.</li><li>Once everything is perfectly aligned, your video is ready, and now you need to export it.</li><li>Click on the export button and select the desired video format from the list, i.e. (MP4, Gif, WMV, FLV, etc.).<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu4.png"                      alt="jujutsu4"                ></li><li>Once you have selected the desired format, click on export, and the video will take some time to render. Once rendered, you can now share the video with your friends and wow them. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jujutsu5.gif"                      alt="jujutsu5"                ></li></ol><p>Conclusion: These are some simple steps using which you can create your own Jujutsu Kaisen TikTok Montage. Now it’s up to you to create new ideas and make interesting videos. We recommend using the Filmora X video editor because it is easy to use and can do wonders for you.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111994/7443" target="_top" id="2111994">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111994" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111994/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037351/7443" target="_top" id="2037351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037351/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094419/7443" target="_top" id="2094419">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094419" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094419/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139108/17108" target="_top" id="2139108">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139108" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139108/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977023">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977023">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977023%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977023/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105867/7443" target="_top" id="2105867">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105867" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105867/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123729/7443" target="_top" id="2123729">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123729" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123729/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657400/16446" target="_top" id="1657400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657400/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-10-2-inch-7th-generation-review-4772313" >Apple iPad 10.2-inch (7th Generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-go-review-4690827" >Microsoft Surface Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-mini-2019-review-4688991" >Apple iPad Mini (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iPad Pro 11-Inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>Price  $799.99</li><li>Release Date  November 2018</li><li>Weight  1.03 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.02 x 9.74 x 0.23 in.</li><li>Color  Space Gray</li><li>Warranty  Applecare</li><li>RAM  4 GB</li><li>Camera  12 MP</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-amplify-your-fb-video-content-a-complete-music-integration-tutorial/"><u>[New] Amplify Your FB Video Content A Complete Music Integration Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-crafting-a-distinctive-image-with-creative-personal-frames-on-tiktok/"><u>[New] Crafting a Distinctive Image with Creative Personal Frames on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-transform-into-a-live-stream-enthusiast-on-tiktok/"><u>[New] In 2024, Transform Into a Live-Stream Enthusiast on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-irecorder-unpacked-what-you-need-to-know/"><u>[New] IRecorder Unpacked What You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-best-practices-for-hash-tags-in-fb-marketing-campaigns-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Best Practices for Hash Tags in FB Marketing Campaigns for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-rhythmic-future-tiktoks-most-iconic-rap-songs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Rhythmic Future TikTok's Most Iconic Rap Songs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-journey-into-the-creative-realm-top-25-tiktok-anime-ideas-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Journey Into the Creative Realm Top 25 TikTok Anime Ideas for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/1723012943877-beat-the-bug-effective-ways-to-prevent-titanfall-2-crashes-now/"><u>Beat the Bug: Effective Ways to Prevent Titanfall 2 Crashes Now!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/best-nokia-g22-pattern-lock-removal-tools-remove-android-pattern-lock-without-losing-data-by-drfone-android/"><u>Best Nokia G22 Pattern Lock Removal Tools Remove Android Pattern Lock Without Losing Data</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-capturing-moments-like-never-before-with-sj-cam-s6/"><u>In 2024, Capturing Moments Like Never Before with SJ-CAM S6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-allshare-cast-to-turn-on-screen-mirroring-on-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Use Allshare Cast To Turn On Screen Mirroring On Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-take-control-how-to-involve-yourself-in-a-friends-live-on-tiktok/"><u>In 2024, Take Control How to Involve Yourself in a Friend's Live on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-elite-iphones-of-2eplusoo-rigorously-tested-by-professionals-detailed-insights/"><u>Unveiling the Elite iPhones of 2E+oo: Rigorously Tested by Professionals, Detailed Insights</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer-3"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

The ones that matter to us are read messages and send messages</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-dyno-permissions-discord.jpg"                      alt="set up permission for bots"                ></p><ol><li>The last step is to verify that you are not a robot yourself and check I’m not a robot.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-to-discord-dyno.jpg"                      alt="connect bots to Discord"                ></p><p>After this, the Dyno bot will be added to your Discord server. To allow the bot to send messages, you need to visit Dyno’s website and turn on the autoresponder, enabling you to set up your auto-reply.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304648">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304648.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304648">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304648.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304648%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304648/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Reply-to-Messages-with-Reactions-on-Discord-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Reply-to-Messages-with-Reactions-on-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Reply to Messages with Reactions on Discord"></a>Part 4: How to Reply to Messages with Reactions on Discord</h2><p>Discord allows you to react to posts with emojis.

It contains all about TikTok Anime ideas; dances, songs, memes, and filters. Let’s find out one-by-one:</p><h3 id="Let’s-Groove"><a href="#Let’s-Groove" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Groove:"></a>Let’s Groove:</h3><p>This is another one of those TikTok trends where individuals show off their talents by dancing to trendy songs or music, which in this instance is a song called “Lets Groove” by an American band named “Earth Wind &amp; Fire“. This trend began when TikToker @absolutesnacc used a remix of Lets Groove to build a fan edit montage incorporating footage of actor Jason Segel from the TV program named “Freaks and Geeks”.</p><h3 id="Trending-dances"><a href="#Trending-dances" class="headerlink" title="Trending dances:"></a>Trending dances:</h3><p>TikTok is recognized for artists who know their movements — and in reality, many of the highest-earning TikTokers are dancers. But due to trendy dances, you don’t have to be an expert to perform the correct choreography. TikTok dances are generally short, pleasant, and entry-level, so amateurs may learn them with minimal effort. This offers a lot of flexibility for putting your twist on it—for example, ripping up the floor in a giant teddy bear costume.</p><h3 id="Prada-Bucket-challenge"><a href="#Prada-Bucket-challenge" class="headerlink" title="Prada Bucket challenge:"></a>Prada Bucket challenge:</h3><p>This TikTok fad is particular to the richer portion of the community, as artists join in this challenge to flaunt their costly attire when sporting a 600$ Prada Bucket hat, thus the name “Prada Bucket challenge”. Participants start by pretending to be “upset” about something, so they put their Prada Bucket hats on, and with some film editing magic, their clothing converts into more costly clothes.</p><h3 id="Glow-ups"><a href="#Glow-ups" class="headerlink" title="Glow-ups:"></a>Glow-ups:</h3><p>At its essence, a glow-up on TikTok is a “before” and “after.” Many artists may submit a few photographs or films depicting themselves as an awkward adolescent, then a last, contemporary clip. Glow-ups also work excellent for encouraging positive interaction. (Usually, one when they appear confident and amazing). These sorts of TikToks are wonderful for the wait-for-it factor: consumers are more willing to watch the complete video to see the finished product.</p><h3 id="Anime-Edits"><a href="#Anime-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Anime Edits:"></a>Anime Edits:</h3><p>If you’re an anime geek you’ve probably already heard about this trend when producers build a montage utilizing clips from their favorite anime series and add some background music simply to liven things up. Although this trend has been going on for a long now, it still doesn’t seem old since the anime fans have been keeping it alive. So, it doesn’t matter whether you enjoy Initial D or Naruto, this trend is relevant to all anime viewers.</p><h3 id="Edgy-humor"><a href="#Edgy-humor" class="headerlink" title="Edgy humor:"></a>Edgy humor:</h3><p>There’s a reason why TikTok is so popular with the under-30 crowd: the brief videos and highly scrollable characteristics of the app make it excellent for comedy, snark, and sass. And although many content producers and skilled social media marketers have discovered ways to convert TikTok into a business, the platform’s core aim is to “inspire creativity and generate joy.” So don’t take it too seriously. The edgier, the better.</p><h3 id="Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family"><a href="#Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family" class="headerlink" title="Making TikToks with Your Family:"></a>Making TikToks with Your Family:</h3><p>This goes hand in hand with being vulnerable and genuine—there’s nothing quite like a nice cameo from Mom, Dad, Grandma, or Grandpa. Because so many TikTok producers are millennials or Gen Z, it’s refreshing (and enjoyable) to see older folks on the platform. The difficult part of this is encouraging your family to join, but if you’ve got one excellent sport, you’ve hit gold. For example, simply try to watch this family dancing blooper without your heartbreak.</p><h3 id="Baked-Feta-Pasta"><a href="#Baked-Feta-Pasta" class="headerlink" title="Baked Feta Pasta:"></a>Baked Feta Pasta:</h3><p>This is a TikTok trend for all those foodies out there who enjoy delicious spaghetti with some cheese. This practice grew so prevalent that the grocery shops in Finland faced a scarcity of feta cheese. The technique of creating this pasta is straightforward, start by adding some cherry tomatoes and garlic in an oven-safe dish, sprinkle some salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, and pour some olive oil before combining the ingredients. Place a block of Feta cheese in the middle and bake in the oven until soft, compress the contents to make a paste, and combine with your favorite Pasta, that’s it! Your Baked Feta Pasta is ready to be served.</p><h3 id="Seamless-Transitions"><a href="#Seamless-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Seamless Transitions:"></a>Seamless Transitions:</h3><p>Another aspect that’s unique to TikTok is the transitions inside movies. The in-app editing tools make it simple to flip from one clip to another in a manner that appears like magic. This might be as basic as keeping your illumination the same and maintaining your camera in the same location. They may also be more sophisticated. Think spinning your camera about, putting your phone on the ground, zooming in and out – honestly, the sky’s the limit. When someone truly nails a transition, it’s virtually hard to view the video just once.</p><h3 id="Pet-Painting"><a href="#Pet-Painting" class="headerlink" title="Pet Painting:"></a>Pet Painting:</h3><p>This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to have your fuzzy companion included in one of your videos. No, you don’t paint a portrait of your pet, your pet performs the painting portion, how you may ask? it’s fairly easy, all you need is a canvas, some liquid colors of your choosing, a huge plastic bag, and a pet, of course, you will also need a paste-like food that your pet enjoys, peanut butter for instance. Start by covering the canvas with the plastic bag and spread peanut butter on the section covering the canvas, gently remove the canvas from the bag and keep the plastic aside.</p><h3 id="Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture"><a href="#Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Referencing Modern Pop Culture:"></a>Referencing Modern Pop Culture:</h3><p>Score some likes, comments, and shares by tapping into an already-huge fan following. Trending TV series and movies frequently inspire their TikTok trends. When Squid Game dominated the globe in 2021, it prompted suspense-making instructions, musical mashups, and many tracksuits. This is just one of the millions of instances of how inventive TikTok fans addressed the program.</p><h3 id="Satisfying-Videos"><a href="#Satisfying-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Satisfying Videos:"></a>Satisfying Videos:</h3><p>This simply possibly be the most widely accepted and least contentious genre ever: the enjoyable video. Like the day-in-the-life films, they are a celebration of the commonplace. So, the likelihood is, you’re already doing something pleasurable to watch. Whether its soap cutting or cake frosting or freezing bubbles, there’s something very relaxing and fulfilling about this type of material.</p><h3 id="Passing-the-Phone"><a href="#Passing-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Passing the Phone:"></a>Passing the Phone:</h3><p>We’re going to top things off with another TikTok trend, this one is a fun way of roasting your friends or family members and, of course, getting them involved in your TikToks. The way these trend works is really simple, you just call out your friend by making funny comments about certain bad habits or characteristics they have and then pass the phone to them because it’s their turn to do the same, so it’s just a series of taking turns roasting your friends and the best part is that there is no limit to how many people can participate.</p><h3 id="Challenge-Freezing-Honey"><a href="#Challenge-Freezing-Honey" class="headerlink" title="Challenge: Freezing Honey"></a>Challenge: Freezing Honey</h3><p>Another TikTok food craze is gaining traction, and it’s safe to assume that Honey is involved. One of the easiest fads to adopt is the freezing honey TikTok craze; everyone has honey and, of course, a freezer. This challenge calls for 100 percent pure honey, since non-pure honey may crystallize at low temperatures. If your honey comes in a plastic bottle, chuck it in the freezer; if it comes in a jar, pour it into a plastic container and remove any lids or bottle tops before freezing, since these may be difficult to remove after freezing.</p><h3 id="Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life"><a href="#Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life" class="headerlink" title="Documenting a Day in The Life:"></a>Documenting a Day in The Life:</h3><p>While grumpy Instagram users may tell you that “no one wants to see your avocado toast,” the truth is that a lot of people do. Many of these films romanticize the mundane, but humor has a place in this medium as well. If you’re a creative who gets a lot of questions in the comments section, here is the place to be. Seeing someone’s daily routine, whether it’s a second-grade teacher, a lawyer, or a couple living in a van, is a rewarding experience. Over 2 million people have liked this “actual day in the life of a vehicle.”</p><h3 id="Classical-Challenges"><a href="#Classical-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Classical Challenges:"></a>Classical Challenges:</h3><p>TikTok thrives on obstacles. For challenges, many TikTok users would all post films aiming to achieve the same thing, like the stair-step challenge, where they would dance up a set of steps in intricate ways. These are generally community-created trends; however, they may take the shape of sponsored hashtags, too. Challenges are a simple way for users on TikTok to feel like they’re part of the community.</p><h3 id="Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me"><a href="#Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me" class="headerlink" title="Tell Me Without Telling Me:"></a>Tell Me Without Telling Me:</h3><p>The creator begins by saying, “Tell me you drive a fast car without telling me you drive a fast car” and then says, “I’ll go first” to start a streak for other users to follow. Users then proceed to show the engine layout of their vehicle, the exhaust note, or possibly a flyby, so following this trend is a good way to make your TikToks stand out. This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to tell your audience what you’re trying to say or to depict certain occurrences subtly.</p><h3 id="Behind-the-scenes-Videos"><a href="#Behind-the-scenes-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Behind-the-scenes Videos:"></a>Behind-the-scenes Videos:</h3><p>We love an inside scoop, and behind-the-scenes films are perfect for teaching and for making viewers feel like they’re receiving something special. If you’re a creative who generates something tangible (like art, cuisine, or fashion) and advertises it on TikTok, a behind-the-scenes film might give your brand an added depth. You can even produce a behind-the-scenes TikTok describing how you made a TikTok. Ontario, California-based Logan’s candies attracted five and a half million followers by releasing TikToks depicting how their sweets were made—it’s a very interesting process.</p><h3 id="Love-Nwantiti-Dance"><a href="#Love-Nwantiti-Dance" class="headerlink" title="Love Nwantiti Dance:"></a>Love Nwantiti Dance:</h3><p>The Love Nwantiti Dance is a dance that is performed by people who love one another. If you like dancing and music, you may try filming a TikTok dance video to capitalize on this trend. Love Nwantiti is a song by CKay, a Nigerian singer and songwriter who goes by the alias “CKay.” The phrase “Nwantiti” means “little love” in Igbo. This is one of those TikTok trends where content producers flash their skills by dancing to hot music or songs, in this instance a tune named “Love Nwantiti.” It is more popular with young people.</p><h3 id="Hashtags-with-Challenges"><a href="#Hashtags-with-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Hashtags with Challenges:"></a>Hashtags with Challenges:</h3><p>Many videos will frequently add a #ForYou hashtag to be featured on the page. Just like any other app, getting to the main page is key to landing a popular TikTok video and collecting new followers. Considering TikTok is starting to look at advertising directly in the app, revenue for TikTokers isn’t far off, and leveraging hashtags to trick the system is important to gaining viewers. TikTok virtually runs on hashtags. It’s what makes the app so entertaining. Everything is shared, and everyone is encouraged to join in. Clicking on hashtags, particularly ones that are developed around challenges, is a simple method to find what others are using to get to the ‘For You’ area.</p><h3 id="Learn-on-TikTok"><a href="#Learn-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Learn on TikTok:"></a>Learn on TikTok:</h3><p>This TikTok trend is a spectacular method for creators to share their ideas, talents, and life hacks and a chance for viewers to expand their knowledge on particular subjects and discover new items that may aid them in their day-to-day lives. The greatest part is that this trend is for everyone since the number of concepts that may be inferred here is practically never-ending, there might be someone excellent at cooking, someone, whose fighting abilities are good, someone who’s strong at arithmetic, or maybe someone who’s good at mending automobiles.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139109/17108" target="_top" id="2139109">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139109" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139109/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>From ramping up your posting schedule to taking part in challenges, and optimizing your hashtags, the inventive methods to get followers and develop a TikTok community are numerous. Regardless, if you find <strong>anime TikTok</strong> cringeworthy and strange, that’s probably because you grew up in the period before the social web. Generation Z’s enjoy the funny internet sharing platform and many now earn money from it. It’s easy, hilarious, and irreverent - and a pleasant change of pace from more serious networks such as Twitter and Facebook. It’s the perfect procrastination app that can lure you in for hours. Ultimately, the greatest strategy to expand your following will come down to your ingenuity, so don’t hold back and start experimenting with the <strong>TikTok anime</strong> videos you’ve always wanted to do.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-efficiently-enhance-your-tiktok-videos-speed/"><u>[New] Efficiently Enhance Your TikTok Videos' Speed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-twitter-broadcast-alive-tweets-guide/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering Twitter Broadcast Alive Tweets Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-exclusive-access-to-the-finest-ae-templates-all-free/"><u>[Updated] Exclusive Access to The Finest AE Templates, All-Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-audience-captivation-at-its-peak-top-20-tiktok-caption-ideas/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Audience Captivation at Its Peak Top 20 TikTok Caption Ideas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-live-broadcasts-in-focus-scrutinizing-the-best-6-microphones-available/"><u>[Updated] Live Broadcasts in Focus Scrutinizing the Best 6 Microphones Available</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exceptional-tiktok-pfp-creations-that-command-attention/"><u>2024 Approved Exceptional TikTok PFP Creations that Command Attention</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-snapchats-boomerang-magic/"><u>A Step-by-Step Guide to Snapchat's Boomerang Magic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/elevate-your-creative-expression-with-smart-caption-techniques-for-tiktoks/"><u>Elevate Your Creative Expression with Smart Caption Techniques for TikToks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/from-dissonance-to-harmony-crafting-audio-transitions-in-audacity/"><u>From Dissonance to Harmony Crafting Audio Transitions in Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-dodging-doubts-a-guide-to-vloggings-most-common-anxieties/"><u>In 2024, Dodging Doubts A Guide to Vlogging's Most Common Anxieties</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/reasons-why-pokemon-gps-does-not-work-on-vivo-y02t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Reasons why Pokémon GPS does not Work On Vivo Y02T? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/taste-trek-journey-through-global-cuisine-secrets/"><u>Taste Trek Journey Through Global Cuisine Secrets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-dual-boot-revolution-on-your-steam-deck-device/"><u>The Dual Boot Revolution on Your Steam Deck Device</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Can I record a slow mo video in Snapchat?</strong></p><p>Technically speaking, no, you cannot. However, once you have recorded a video at a normal speed in Snapchat, you can apply the built-in Slow Motion filter to it by swiping the screen from left to right until you see the Snail icon at the center. The Snail icon represents the Slow Motion filter that reduces the playback speed when applied.</p><p><strong>2. Besides slow-motion, which speed filters does Snapchat have?</strong></p><p>In addition to <strong>slow motion Snapchat</strong> also has Forward and Fast Forward filters that increase the playback speed. While the Forward filter increases the speed slightly, the Fast Forward one enhances it drastically.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>When using an iPhone, even though the SLO-MO mode enables you to record footage in slow motion, you don’t get many options. Therefore, it would be safe to say that it is easy to slow down the speed of a video if you have a dedicated third-party post-production app. However, if you want to go for a convenient method, learning <strong>how to slow down a video on Snapchat</strong> is an extremely simple and straightforward process.</p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Record a Slo-Mo Video and Upload to Snapchat</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Make Flash and Smooth Slo Mo Video for Snapchat</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">FAQs about Slowing Down Snapchat Video</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Add-Slow-Motion-Effects-to-Video-Using-the-Snapchat-App-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Add-Slow-Motion-Effects-to-Video-Using-the-Snapchat-App-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Add Slow Motion Effects to Video Using the Snapchat App"></a>Part 1: How to Add Slow Motion Effects to Video Using the Snapchat App</h2><p>Snapchat has a built-in Slow Motion filter that reduces the playback speed of a video when applied.

You can learn <strong>how to slow down on Snapchat</strong> by following the instructions that are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Record a Video</strong></p><p>Launch Snapchat on your smartphone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), make sure that the <strong>Camera</strong> section is selected from the bottom, tap and hold down the <strong>Capture</strong> button that is present at the lower part of the interface, and let go of it when you are done recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-videos-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="capture videos snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Apply the Slow Motion Filter</strong></p><p>Once the video is recorded, swipe the screen from left to right.

This will reduce the playback speed of the clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-slow-motion-effect.jpg"                      alt="snapchat slow motion effect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Decorate the Video (Optional)</strong></p><p>Use the options present on the upper-right area of the screen to further decorate the video and&#x2F;or add annotations to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-video-editing-features.jpg"                      alt="snapchat video editing features"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Share or Publish the Video</strong></p><p>Once everything is done, tap <strong>Send To</strong> from the bottom-right corner to share the video with your family, friends, and colleagues, or publish it as a story that remains available for the next 24 hours.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Record Slo-Mo videos on iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144298/7443" target="_top" id="2144298">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144298" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144298/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-a-Slo-Mo-Video-and-Upload-to-Snapchat-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-a-Slo-Mo-Video-and-Upload-to-Snapchat-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Record a Slo-Mo Video and Upload to Snapchat"></a>Part 2: How to Record a Slo-Mo Video and Upload to Snapchat</h2><p>With Snapchat, even though you don’t require any third-party tool to reduce the playback speed of a video, the app has certain limitations. For example, it doesn’t allow you to set a zoom level, you are stuck with the framerate that the app has to offer, etc.</p><p>Because of this, many people prefer to use different methods to record a video in slow motion with their preferences, and then upload it to Snapchat. This approach also eliminates the need to swipe the screen several times merely to use a single slow-motion filter.</p><p>Fortunately, iPhone has a built-in SLO-MO mode in its Camera app that allows you to capture the videos in slow motion. To learn <strong>how to do slow mo on Snapchat</strong> with the iPhone’s Camera app, you can follow the instructions that are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the iPhone’s SLO-MO Mode</strong></p><p>Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen from left to right until you get to the <strong>SLO-MO</strong> mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg"                      alt="iphone slow motion capture mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Set Recording Preferences</strong></p><p>Tap the number that is present at the top-right corner (<strong>240</strong> here) to toggle between different framerates, tap <strong>1x</strong> from the lower-center area, swipe slightly up, and then use the wheel that appears next to define your preferred zoom level.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-slow-motion-zoom-level-iphone.jpg"                      alt="adjust slow motion zoom level iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Start and Stop the Recording</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Record</strong> button to start the recording, and tap <strong>Stop</strong> when you’re done.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that the duration of the recorded video doesn’t exceed 60 seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Upload the Slow-Motion Video to Snapchat</strong></p><p>After the video is recorded in slow motion, close the <strong>Camera</strong> app, launch Snapchat, and tap the <strong>Gallery</strong> icon from the left side of the <strong>Capture</strong> button on the <strong>Camera</strong> section. From the <strong>Memories</strong> screen, go to the <strong>Camera Roll</strong> tab, and tap to select the video that you recorded in the previous step.</p><p>Next, optionally, tap the <strong>Edit</strong> icon from the bottom-left corner to decorate the video and&#x2F;or add annotations to it, and follow the process as explained in the previous section to share the clip with your family, friends, or colleagues, or publish it as your story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-iphone-slow-motion-video-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="upload iphone slow motion video snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-Flash-and-Smooth-Slo-Mo-Video-for-Snapchat-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-Flash-and-Smooth-Slo-Mo-Video-for-Snapchat-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make Flash and Smooth Slo Mo Video for Snapchat"></a>Part 3: How to Make Flash and Smooth Slo Mo Video for Snapchat</h2><p>Although iPhone has the built-in SLO-MO mode that even enables you to set your preferred framerate and zoom level before recording, it still doesn’t allow you to slow down different parts of a video in different speed at your convenience. You can either record the entire video in slow motion or at a normal speed.</p><p>This is where a third-party app comes into play.

On the next screen, tap <strong>Custom</strong> from the lower area, and then tap <strong>Edit</strong>. From the next panel, drag the beat points down to reduce the speed (or drag them above the line to increase).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-curve-speed-custom-edit.jpg"                      alt="capcut curve speed custom edit"                ></p><p>Notice that each beat point represents a particular section of the video, and dragging it down reduces the playback speed of that segment.

The service has launched several innovative features over the years and one of their latest and popular tools is cameos. It is a fun way that one can express themselves, with their own faces plastered on comic characters or on bodies of animals and so forth.</p><ol><li><strong>What is a Snapchat Cameo?</strong></li></ol><p>If you have been seeing your friends add their faces to fun emojis, cartoons, and other figures, you could do that too with this fun feature on Snapchat. A cameo is an option that allows you to add your face to comic characters or animals or even create funny videos with them. You become a star of looping, short videos that you can send across to your friends. It is a great way to express your emotions in moments. Instead of messages, <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> are an innovative way to say hello, express your feelings, and so forth. It is possible to customize captions and add them to the cameos that you create.</p><p>These are easy to add and send in chat messages since it is an option that occurs next to the stickers. It is available on the apps created for Android and iOS devices. You can choose from more than 150 cameos which makes it a great feature.</p><p>Indeed, who would not want to have cool means to express themselves, their opinions, or tell their close friends what they feel? Snapchat offers several unique ways of expressing yourself. While you could attach videos or memes that express what you feel, with a cameo you can make that even more personalized and unique. Add your face to cool videos, animations, or pics. What’s more, you can add text in different fonts and with interesting effects. It is nothing short of creating a video by yourself. That too can be easily done in a matter of seconds, while you are on chat with your friends or loved ones.</p><ol><li><strong>How to Use Snapchat Cameo?</strong></li></ol><p>There are easy ways to get started when using <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong>. All you need is to tap on the button provided, on the sticker bar. It involves taking a selfie or choosing a picture or a video that you already have on your phone or tablet. If a friend has set up the feature in their Snapchat and is chatting live, it is possible to co-star in it together.</p><p>Here are simple ways to get started:</p><ul><li>Start by choosing a contact on the Snap list with whom you wish to start a conversation or want to send a pic or video using this feature. You will find the functionality while you are texting and adding effects to the conversation. For this reason, the function appears in the borders of the keyboard you use.</li><li>Once the chat page opens up, find the face icon next to the chat bar which shows above the keyboard. This leads to the emoji page along where you will find the <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> option at the bottom.</li><li>You will find the cameo icon at the bottom of this section. It looks like a face with a + sign on it. This will lead you to create the cameo video or pic.</li><li>It starts by activating the selfie camera. It aligns the face on the camera with an outline in blue. It will instruct you to take the selfie picture.</li><li>You will then get options for adding filters to the cameo of your face. This can consist of pictures you have in your gallery or a repository of images and cartoons that the app provides. You could also source images from the internet or videos to use for this purpose.</li><li>Once the filters are applied and captions added, you are ready to send across the cameo to your selected contact. The <strong>Snapchat cameos</strong> you create get added to the chat option directly.</li><li>It is also possible to create a two-person cameo, especially if the person’s pics are available on your gallery of images. You can also add text to make the pics more expressive.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>How to Fix Snapchat Cameo Not Showing up?</strong></li></ol><p>Users of the Snapchat app can use cameo as one of the innovative new features that help them add their faces to funny videos, cartoons, and so forth. However, in certain instances, the cameos might not show up. In such cases you can fix such issues with the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Update App</strong></li></ul><p>This is a solution that might prove effective. You could opt for updating the app by downloading the latest version of the app from the Apple or Android app store. Once the app updates and installs, you might find that the issue is resolved. One could also use the beta version of the app available at online stores.</p><ul><li><strong>Check Settings on the Phone</strong></li></ul><p>This is another possible way to get the issue resolved. Visit the phone settings. Opt for the section on app management. Here search for the Snapchat app. Here you could opt to uninstall and use Force Stop. Visit storage options and clear all data. You can then restart your phone. Once you open the app you could find the cameo issue resolved.</p><ul><li><strong>Install VPN</strong></li></ul><p>There could be instances when the feature does not show up in the app due to the restrictions that countries impose.
