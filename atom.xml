However, it’s perhaps one of the primary viral dances to break out of the app’s confines itself and influence multiple other TikTokers to strive to be trending all over.</p><p>You need to understand the anatomy of this TikTok 2022 dance going famous along with its strategies to know how a TikTok dance can become popular around the globe.</p><p>The original dance was by Atlanta-based 14-year-old Jalaiah Harmon in September 2019 and promptly fueled up with middle and high school students. Given the song “Lottery” by K Camp, Harmon’s dance has been observed in talent shows and at school pep rallies for TikTok competitions.</p><p>Here’s a girl named Kara Leigh Cannella, who is a senior dance major at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia</p><p>She was scrolling through TikTok one day this fall when she came across a sound that grabbed her attention. It was called HOOPLA, a 15-second clip by the user known as @kyleyoumadethat, and it promptly made her wish to dance.</p><p>She began by improvising, as she often does while choreographing for TikTok. Between famous moves like the Woah and the Wave, she mimed releasing a basketball into the air and dribbling it between her legs, reflecting sound themes (which samples the song “Basketball” 2002 Lil Bow Wow ).</p><p>“Then I cleaned up the moves,” she says, “because I was like, ‘I don’t want to make this too hard.’ “</p><p>Cannella, 22, had struck an excellent balance for TikTok dance virality though she was not aware of it yet: something rhythmically satisfying and eye-catching but still accessible, not beyond the real amateur dancers. She showed the dance in her bathroom and posted it with a call to “try it and tag me.”</p><p>To her surprise, by the following day, the video received 10,000 likes, and soon the dance was all around the TikTok platform, also tried by the app’s most-followed user, a 16-year-old dancer, Charli D’Amelio. She posted it for her then-95 million followers.</p><p>So, this was the overall pick behind popular TikTok dances 2022, which you can observe that there’s no such rocket science in letting dance become highly trending.</p><p>Dance has always found a social media audience, but TikTok, more so than other platforms, has given a boom to its own highly recognizable, simply reproducible style.</p><p>Being inspired from a lexicon of hip-hop–inspired moves—like the Dougie, Throw It Back, and the Dice Roll, to name just a few—the micro TikTok dance songs 2022 are generally front-facing most animated from the hips up.</p><p>They specifically cater to the smartphone screen vertical frame. Governed by time limits between 15 to 60 seconds, they also tend to preserve in a single place; you can do them anywhere pretty much.</p><p>While many professional dancers display their hard-earned TikTok skills, the app, globally released in 2018, has become recognized as a space where everyone is for dance.</p><p>“It’s not about having the perfect dance body; it doesn’t matter if you’re a pro,” says Alessandro Bogliari, the Influencer Marketing Factory’s CEO, a company that ramps within SMM campaigns. “It’s about re-creating and having certain funny moves.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024"><a href="#Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024"></a>Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024</h2><p>What does it take to get mentioned as a dancer regarding popular TikTok dances 2022?

However, it’s perhaps one of the primary viral dances to break out of the app’s confines itself and influence multiple other TikTokers to strive to be trending all over.</p><p>You need to understand the anatomy of this TikTok 2022 dance going famous along with its strategies to know how a TikTok dance can become popular around the globe.</p><p>The original dance was by Atlanta-based 14-year-old Jalaiah Harmon in September 2019 and promptly fueled up with middle and high school students. Given the song “Lottery” by K Camp, Harmon’s dance has been observed in talent shows and at school pep rallies for TikTok competitions.</p><p>Here’s a girl named Kara Leigh Cannella, who is a senior dance major at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia</p><p>She was scrolling through TikTok one day this fall when she came across a sound that grabbed her attention. It was called HOOPLA, a 15-second clip by the user known as @kyleyoumadethat, and it promptly made her wish to dance.</p><p>She began by improvising, as she often does while choreographing for TikTok. Between famous moves like the Woah and the Wave, she mimed releasing a basketball into the air and dribbling it between her legs, reflecting sound themes (which samples the song “Basketball” 2002 Lil Bow Wow ).</p><p>“Then I cleaned up the moves,” she says, “because I was like, ‘I don’t want to make this too hard.’ “</p><p>Cannella, 22, had struck an excellent balance for TikTok dance virality though she was not aware of it yet: something rhythmically satisfying and eye-catching but still accessible, not beyond the real amateur dancers. She showed the dance in her bathroom and posted it with a call to “try it and tag me.”</p><p>To her surprise, by the following day, the video received 10,000 likes, and soon the dance was all around the TikTok platform, also tried by the app’s most-followed user, a 16-year-old dancer, Charli D’Amelio. She posted it for her then-95 million followers.</p><p>So, this was the overall pick behind popular TikTok dances 2022, which you can observe that there’s no such rocket science in letting dance become highly trending.</p><p>Dance has always found a social media audience, but TikTok, more so than other platforms, has given a boom to its own highly recognizable, simply reproducible style.</p><p>Being inspired from a lexicon of hip-hop–inspired moves—like the Dougie, Throw It Back, and the Dice Roll, to name just a few—the micro TikTok dance songs 2022 are generally front-facing most animated from the hips up.</p><p>They specifically cater to the smartphone screen vertical frame. Governed by time limits between 15 to 60 seconds, they also tend to preserve in a single place; you can do them anywhere pretty much.</p><p>While many professional dancers display their hard-earned TikTok skills, the app, globally released in 2018, has become recognized as a space where everyone is for dance.</p><p>“It’s not about having the perfect dance body; it doesn’t matter if you’re a pro,” says Alessandro Bogliari, the Influencer Marketing Factory’s CEO, a company that ramps within SMM campaigns. “It’s about re-creating and having certain funny moves.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024-1"><a href="#Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024"></a>Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024</h2><p>What does it take to get mentioned as a dancer regarding popular TikTok dances 2022?

However, it’s perhaps one of the primary viral dances to break out of the app’s confines itself and influence multiple other TikTokers to strive to be trending all over.</p><p>You need to understand the anatomy of this TikTok 2022 dance going famous along with its strategies to know how a TikTok dance can become popular around the globe.</p><p>The original dance was by Atlanta-based 14-year-old Jalaiah Harmon in September 2019 and promptly fueled up with middle and high school students. Given the song “Lottery” by K Camp, Harmon’s dance has been observed in talent shows and at school pep rallies for TikTok competitions.</p><p>Here’s a girl named Kara Leigh Cannella, who is a senior dance major at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia</p><p>She was scrolling through TikTok one day this fall when she came across a sound that grabbed her attention. It was called HOOPLA, a 15-second clip by the user known as @kyleyoumadethat, and it promptly made her wish to dance.</p><p>She began by improvising, as she often does while choreographing for TikTok. Between famous moves like the Woah and the Wave, she mimed releasing a basketball into the air and dribbling it between her legs, reflecting sound themes (which samples the song “Basketball” 2002 Lil Bow Wow ).</p><p>“Then I cleaned up the moves,” she says, “because I was like, ‘I don’t want to make this too hard.’ “</p><p>Cannella, 22, had struck an excellent balance for TikTok dance virality though she was not aware of it yet: something rhythmically satisfying and eye-catching but still accessible, not beyond the real amateur dancers. She showed the dance in her bathroom and posted it with a call to “try it and tag me.”</p><p>To her surprise, by the following day, the video received 10,000 likes, and soon the dance was all around the TikTok platform, also tried by the app’s most-followed user, a 16-year-old dancer, Charli D’Amelio. She posted it for her then-95 million followers.</p><p>So, this was the overall pick behind popular TikTok dances 2022, which you can observe that there’s no such rocket science in letting dance become highly trending.</p><p>Dance has always found a social media audience, but TikTok, more so than other platforms, has given a boom to its own highly recognizable, simply reproducible style.</p><p>Being inspired from a lexicon of hip-hop–inspired moves—like the Dougie, Throw It Back, and the Dice Roll, to name just a few—the micro TikTok dance songs 2022 are generally front-facing most animated from the hips up.</p><p>They specifically cater to the smartphone screen vertical frame. Governed by time limits between 15 to 60 seconds, they also tend to preserve in a single place; you can do them anywhere pretty much.</p><p>While many professional dancers display their hard-earned TikTok skills, the app, globally released in 2018, has become recognized as a space where everyone is for dance.</p><p>“It’s not about having the perfect dance body; it doesn’t matter if you’re a pro,” says Alessandro Bogliari, the Influencer Marketing Factory’s CEO, a company that ramps within SMM campaigns. “It’s about re-creating and having certain funny moves.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024-2"><a href="#Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024"></a>Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024</h2><p>What does it take to get mentioned as a dancer regarding popular TikTok dances 2022?

However, it’s perhaps one of the primary viral dances to break out of the app’s confines itself and influence multiple other TikTokers to strive to be trending all over.</p><p>You need to understand the anatomy of this TikTok 2022 dance going famous along with its strategies to know how a TikTok dance can become popular around the globe.</p><p>The original dance was by Atlanta-based 14-year-old Jalaiah Harmon in September 2019 and promptly fueled up with middle and high school students. Given the song “Lottery” by K Camp, Harmon’s dance has been observed in talent shows and at school pep rallies for TikTok competitions.</p><p>Here’s a girl named Kara Leigh Cannella, who is a senior dance major at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia</p><p>She was scrolling through TikTok one day this fall when she came across a sound that grabbed her attention. It was called HOOPLA, a 15-second clip by the user known as @kyleyoumadethat, and it promptly made her wish to dance.</p><p>She began by improvising, as she often does while choreographing for TikTok. Between famous moves like the Woah and the Wave, she mimed releasing a basketball into the air and dribbling it between her legs, reflecting sound themes (which samples the song “Basketball” 2002 Lil Bow Wow ).</p><p>“Then I cleaned up the moves,” she says, “because I was like, ‘I don’t want to make this too hard.’ “</p><p>Cannella, 22, had struck an excellent balance for TikTok dance virality though she was not aware of it yet: something rhythmically satisfying and eye-catching but still accessible, not beyond the real amateur dancers. She showed the dance in her bathroom and posted it with a call to “try it and tag me.”</p><p>To her surprise, by the following day, the video received 10,000 likes, and soon the dance was all around the TikTok platform, also tried by the app’s most-followed user, a 16-year-old dancer, Charli D’Amelio. She posted it for her then-95 million followers.</p><p>So, this was the overall pick behind popular TikTok dances 2022, which you can observe that there’s no such rocket science in letting dance become highly trending.</p><p>Dance has always found a social media audience, but TikTok, more so than other platforms, has given a boom to its own highly recognizable, simply reproducible style.</p><p>Being inspired from a lexicon of hip-hop–inspired moves—like the Dougie, Throw It Back, and the Dice Roll, to name just a few—the micro TikTok dance songs 2022 are generally front-facing most animated from the hips up.</p><p>They specifically cater to the smartphone screen vertical frame. Governed by time limits between 15 to 60 seconds, they also tend to preserve in a single place; you can do them anywhere pretty much.</p><p>While many professional dancers display their hard-earned TikTok skills, the app, globally released in 2018, has become recognized as a space where everyone is for dance.</p><p>“It’s not about having the perfect dance body; it doesn’t matter if you’re a pro,” says Alessandro Bogliari, the Influencer Marketing Factory’s CEO, a company that ramps within SMM campaigns. “It’s about re-creating and having certain funny moves.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024-3"><a href="#Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024"></a>Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024</h2><p>What does it take to get mentioned as a dancer regarding popular TikTok dances 2022?

The aspect ratio, the dimension, the orientation, and of course, the length!</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> The majority of the people use Tiktok on their smartphones, so the aspect ratio for a Tiktok video should be 9:16 or 1:1 if there are sidebars.</p><p><strong>Dimension:</strong> The recommended dimension for a Tiktok video is 1080 x 1920.</p><p><strong>Video Orientation:</strong> As mentioned earlier, users usually watch Tiktok videos on their smartphones, so a video with a vertical orientation is much easier to watch compared to a video in landscape mode for which one has to tilt their phones.</p><p><strong>Video Length:</strong> Tiktok videos are usually 15 to 60 seconds long depending on the content, but my advice would be to keep them short, as people usually watch shorter videos till the end and might get bored if the video is too long.</p><p><strong>Video File Size:</strong> The file size for iOS devices is 287.6 MB max, and for Android, it is 72 MB.</p><p><strong>Supported Format:</strong> The video format compatible with Tiktok is MP4 and MOV.</p><p>If you keep these basic requirements in mind and make videos that fall within these criteria, I’m sure your videos will be watch-worthy. However, there are other elements to consider as well, like…</p><h3 id="2-Best-Practices-to-Make-Successful-Tiktok-Videos"><a href="#2-Best-Practices-to-Make-Successful-Tiktok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2.

Best Practices to Make Successful Tiktok Videos</strong></h3><p>Tiktok video requirements will help you create videos with the perfect orientation, dimension, and aspect ratio. However, if you want to make videos that get millions of views, go viral, and increase your followers, you must know the best practices to make successful Tiktok videos.</p><p>For instance:</p><p><strong>Post Frequently:</strong> If you want to appear on the FYP, you must post often! The more videos you post, the more the chances to come in front of the audience. And, when the audience sees you regularly, they will get acquainted and start following you to see more of your content.</p><p><strong>Follow the Trends:</strong> Tiktok is all about trends. Something goes viral, and everyone starts making the same content to jump on the bandwagon. The trick is to make the same thing in a unique way. Therefore…</p><p><strong>Be Authentic:</strong> The only way you can be unique is to be authentic, be you! If you keep your originality intact even when following the trend, chances are the audience might just click with your content.</p><p><strong>Choose a Niche:</strong> While, Tiktok is known for having all sorts of video content, ranging from comedy, to sad, to just being motivational, you need to find something you’re good at. For instance, if you can sing well, you can post videos of you singing famous songs. Or, if you can paint well, you can post videos of you painting something. You will reach the right audience, and they will follow you!</p><p>If you ask me, I could watch ASMR cooking videos for hours!</p><h2 id="3-Methods-to-Find-a-Viral-Titok-Topic"><a href="#3-Methods-to-Find-a-Viral-Titok-Topic" class="headerlink" title="3.

Something like this:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKab37F/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKab37F/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Satisfying ASMR Videos:</strong> Satisfying ASMR videos are getting increasingly popular.

Best Practices to Write Attractive Tiktok Captions"></a><strong>1. Best Practices to Write Attractive Tiktok Captions</strong></h3><p>Here are some tips to help your videos go viral due to the captions:</p><p><strong>Quotes:</strong> A caption can be any line that describes the video or a quote just to grab attention. You can use famous quotes or a dialogue that’s trending to make your caption attractive.</p><p><strong>Hashtags:</strong> You can also use viral hashtags in your captions to make your video appear on the FYP or if someone searches for that particular hashtag. Another tip is to use generic hashtags alongside the viral ones, like #Art #Funny #Asmr, etc.</p><p><strong>Mentions:</strong> Mentioning famous Tiktok accounts in your caption can also make people watch your video.</p><p><strong>Emojis:</strong> Using emojis in the caption is a good idea to grab attention and make it worth reading.</p><p>We’re done with how to make watch-worthy Tiktok videos and add engaging captions. But did you know that the video cover also plays an essential role in getting more views?</p><h2 id="Tiktok-Video-Cover"><a href="#Tiktok-Video-Cover" class="headerlink" title="Tiktok Video Cover"></a><strong>Tiktok Video Cover</strong></h2><p>Like influencers use catchy thumbnails for their YouTube videos; similarly, TikTok videos also have video covers. So, what should one do to make an attractive TikTok cover?</p><h3 id="1-Requirements-for-TikTok-Video-Cover"><a href="#1-Requirements-for-TikTok-Video-Cover" class="headerlink" title="1. Requirements for TikTok Video Cover"></a><strong>1. Requirements for TikTok Video Cover</strong></h3><p>A thumbnail or video cover is a crucial deciding factor whether to click and watch a TikTok video or not. Therefore, when choosing a cover for your video, make sure it:</p><ul><li>Accurately portrays the content</li><li>Creates excitement among the audience</li><li>Catches their attention</li></ul><p>If you succeed in doing these 3 things, the audience will be definitely compelled to click on your video!</p><h3 id="2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover"><a href="#2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover" class="headerlink" title="2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover"></a><strong>2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover</strong></h3><p>If you want to create an attractive TikTok video cover, here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Include Text:</strong> A title text on the video cover explains the exact purpose of your video. This helps people decide whether they want to consume the content or not.</p><p>For example, if I come across a TikTok video with the title text that says, “5 Tips To Make Your Cat Love You,” I would probably not click on it because I’m not a cat person. However, people with cats would waste no time watching the same video.</p><p>Additionally, a title text can also create a sense of curiosity for the audience and compels them to click and see what happens next. For instance, a TikTok video titled “I Almost Died!” will create suspense, and people will definitely want to know what happened.</p><p><strong>Use a Good Font Style:</strong> I always recommend using a clear, bold font style as it is easy to read. If you use an excessively curvy style or one that does not have clear letters, the audience might have difficulty reading it on the first attempt.</p><p>Also, staying consistent with a specific font style for your thumbnails helps you stand out. People will start recognizing your videos even before looking at the name.</p><p>So, choose your font wisely!</p><p><strong>Use Pleasant-Looking Contrast:</strong> Here, we are referring to the background color and the font color. Make sure they complement each other! If you’re using a light background, make sure the title text font is dark and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Add Few Objects Only:</strong> Make sure your TikTok video cover does not have too many objects in it. Stick to a simple text, an image, and a background. Adding an image, bold font style, bright background, and throwing in a couple of stickers may give a cluttered look. The trick is to keep it simple and neat.</p><p>With that sorted, let me show a few examples of TikTok video covers that successfully do the trick!</p><h2 id="3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover"><a href="#3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover" class="headerlink" title="3.

Best Practices to Write Attractive Tiktok Captions"></a><strong>1. Best Practices to Write Attractive Tiktok Captions</strong></h3><p>Here are some tips to help your videos go viral due to the captions:</p><p><strong>Quotes:</strong> A caption can be any line that describes the video or a quote just to grab attention. You can use famous quotes or a dialogue that’s trending to make your caption attractive.</p><p><strong>Hashtags:</strong> You can also use viral hashtags in your captions to make your video appear on the FYP or if someone searches for that particular hashtag. Another tip is to use generic hashtags alongside the viral ones, like #Art #Funny #Asmr, etc.</p><p><strong>Mentions:</strong> Mentioning famous Tiktok accounts in your caption can also make people watch your video.</p><p><strong>Emojis:</strong> Using emojis in the caption is a good idea to grab attention and make it worth reading.</p><p>We’re done with how to make watch-worthy Tiktok videos and add engaging captions. But did you know that the video cover also plays an essential role in getting more views?</p><h2 id="Tiktok-Video-Cover-2"><a href="#Tiktok-Video-Cover-2" class="headerlink" title="Tiktok Video Cover"></a><strong>Tiktok Video Cover</strong></h2><p>Like influencers use catchy thumbnails for their YouTube videos; similarly, TikTok videos also have video covers. So, what should one do to make an attractive TikTok cover?</p><h3 id="1-Requirements-for-TikTok-Video-Cover-2"><a href="#1-Requirements-for-TikTok-Video-Cover-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Requirements for TikTok Video Cover"></a><strong>1. Requirements for TikTok Video Cover</strong></h3><p>A thumbnail or video cover is a crucial deciding factor whether to click and watch a TikTok video or not. Therefore, when choosing a cover for your video, make sure it:</p><ul><li>Accurately portrays the content</li><li>Creates excitement among the audience</li><li>Catches their attention</li></ul><p>If you succeed in doing these 3 things, the audience will be definitely compelled to click on your video!</p><h3 id="2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover-2"><a href="#2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover"></a><strong>2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover</strong></h3><p>If you want to create an attractive TikTok video cover, here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Include Text:</strong> A title text on the video cover explains the exact purpose of your video. This helps people decide whether they want to consume the content or not.</p><p>For example, if I come across a TikTok video with the title text that says, “5 Tips To Make Your Cat Love You,” I would probably not click on it because I’m not a cat person. However, people with cats would waste no time watching the same video.</p><p>Additionally, a title text can also create a sense of curiosity for the audience and compels them to click and see what happens next. For instance, a TikTok video titled “I Almost Died!” will create suspense, and people will definitely want to know what happened.</p><p><strong>Use a Good Font Style:</strong> I always recommend using a clear, bold font style as it is easy to read. If you use an excessively curvy style or one that does not have clear letters, the audience might have difficulty reading it on the first attempt.</p><p>Also, staying consistent with a specific font style for your thumbnails helps you stand out. People will start recognizing your videos even before looking at the name.</p><p>So, choose your font wisely!</p><p><strong>Use Pleasant-Looking Contrast:</strong> Here, we are referring to the background color and the font color. Make sure they complement each other! If you’re using a light background, make sure the title text font is dark and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Add Few Objects Only:</strong> Make sure your TikTok video cover does not have too many objects in it. Stick to a simple text, an image, and a background. Adding an image, bold font style, bright background, and throwing in a couple of stickers may give a cluttered look. The trick is to keep it simple and neat.</p><p>With that sorted, let me show a few examples of TikTok video covers that successfully do the trick!</p><h2 id="3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover-2"><a href="#3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

A mix of lip sync videos, music, and micro-video content, TikTok is extremely popular with Gen Z. Over the years, TikTok has continued to enhance the user experience by adding new features, effects, and guidelines.</p><p>Text-to-speech is one of the newest features to be added to the popular platform and it provides an additional way to add something innovative to the video uploads. Announced in December 2020, <strong>text to speech on TikTok</strong> lets creators put their text over their videos and have a Siri-like voice read it out loud.</p><p>TikTok’s text-to-speech feature was added to make the platform accessible to more people by providing an easy way for text to be heard as well as read. Consequently, using this option in video creation is one way that content creators can ensure their videos appeal to a larger number of viewers, while also offering a more comprehensive experience in general.</p><p>Since its launch, the feature has been going viral. Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content. Also, it is a great way to get a message across without actually speaking during the video. No matter the reason it is used, the fact that many are turning to text-to-speech makes it a great addition to TikTok.</p><p>Wondering how to get the text to speech on TikTok for your next video? Here’s a detailed insight into this new feature.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?"></a>Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</h2><p>In December 2020, TikTok began rolling out a new text-to-speech feature that automatically turns text into a voiceover as users watch videos that have the feature enabled. The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.</p><p>Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/text-to-speech-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="text-to-speech tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: dexerto.com</p><p>There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.</p><p>Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.</p><p>Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?"></a>Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</h2><p>Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.</p><p>The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.</p><p>The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?"></a>Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</h2><p>Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok? Check out the step-by-step guide below without any further ado!</p><h4 id="Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version"><a href="#Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version"></a>Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version</h4><p>First things first, ensure your TikTok is updated to the latest version so that you have the TikTok text-to-speech function. Many people have the natural human tendency to push updates as far as technologically possible. But, if you are perplexed about how to do text to speech on TikTok, ensure you have the latest version of this social media app before anything else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/latest-version-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="latest version tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start Recording a Video"></a>Step 2: Start Recording a Video</h4><p>Take into account what you wish to say beforehand and have a rough idea of how quickly you want it to be read as the text to speech entry can be as long as your video. After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="start-record video tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Enter-Your-Text"><a href="#Step-3-Enter-Your-Text" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Enter Your Text"></a>Step 3: Enter Your Text</h4><p>Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud. Ensure you keep in mind the length. Once you have entered the text, tap ‘<strong>Done</strong>’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will insert a customizable text box over your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/enter-text-tiktok.png"                      alt="enter text tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech"></a>Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech</h4><p>When it comes to using text to speech on TikTok, this is another crucial step.Once you enter the text into the TikTok video, tap the Textbox and you will have three options: Text-to-Speech, Set Duration, and Edit. Select Text-to-Speech and the inbuilt text-to-speech AI of TikTok will read your text over the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tap-text-to-speech-tiktok.png"                      alt="tap-text-to speech tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally"><a href="#Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Save the Video Locally"></a>Step 5: Save the Video Locally</h4><p>It is here that you will venture outside TikTok to change the text-to-speech voice. Once your video is ready in every other way, consider saving it locally on your device and not post it for everyone to see. Ensure the “<strong>Save to Device</strong>” option is active and you can post it privately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-to-device-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="save-to device tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers"><a href="#Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers"></a>Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers</h4><p>Next, you have to download a video editor – ideally for your smartphone – with voice modifiers. Adding ‘video’ into the search keywords alongside ‘Voice Modifier’ or ‘Voice Changer’ will bring up a list of options. Remember; many voice changers or free editors will either block the option to save edited videos onto the device behind a paywall or leave a watermark.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave"><a href="#Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave"></a>Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave</h4><p>Once you have chosen your video editor, launch it and import your saved TikTok video. Here, you can edit the audio just like any other video, and voice modifiers can be applied if the video editing tool you choose has them. Apply different effects you’d like and resave your new and modified TikTok video to your device.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok"><a href="#Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok"></a>Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok</h4><p>Open the TikTok app and upload the new, edited TikTok as a singular video directly, without any further edits.

Many people have the natural human tendency to push updates as far as technologically possible. But, if you are perplexed about how to do text to speech on TikTok, ensure you have the latest version of this social media app before anything else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/latest-version-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="latest version tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video-1"><a href="#Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start Recording a Video"></a>Step 2: Start Recording a Video</h4><p>Take into account what you wish to say beforehand and have a rough idea of how quickly you want it to be read as the text to speech entry can be as long as your video. After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="start-record video tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Enter-Your-Text-1"><a href="#Step-3-Enter-Your-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Enter Your Text"></a>Step 3: Enter Your Text</h4><p>Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud. Ensure you keep in mind the length. Once you have entered the text, tap ‘<strong>Done</strong>’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will insert a customizable text box over your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/enter-text-tiktok.png"                      alt="enter text tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech-1"><a href="#Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech"></a>Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech</h4><p>When it comes to using text to speech on TikTok, this is another crucial step.Once you enter the text into the TikTok video, tap the Textbox and you will have three options: Text-to-Speech, Set Duration, and Edit.

Once your video is ready in every other way, consider saving it locally on your device and not post it for everyone to see. Ensure the “<strong>Save to Device</strong>” option is active and you can post it privately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-to-device-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="save-to device tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers-1"><a href="#Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers"></a>Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers</h4><p>Next, you have to download a video editor – ideally for your smartphone – with voice modifiers.

Remember; many voice changers or free editors will either block the option to save edited videos onto the device behind a paywall or leave a watermark.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave-1"><a href="#Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave"></a>Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave</h4><p>Once you have chosen your video editor, launch it and import your saved TikTok video. Here, you can edit the audio just like any other video, and voice modifiers can be applied if the video editing tool you choose has them. Apply different effects you’d like and resave your new and modified TikTok video to your device.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok-1"><a href="#Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok"></a>Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok</h4><p>Open the TikTok app and upload the new, edited TikTok as a singular video directly, without any further edits.

A mix of lip sync videos, music, and micro-video content, TikTok is extremely popular with Gen Z. Over the years, TikTok has continued to enhance the user experience by adding new features, effects, and guidelines.</p><p>Text-to-speech is one of the newest features to be added to the popular platform and it provides an additional way to add something innovative to the video uploads. Announced in December 2020, <strong>text to speech on TikTok</strong> lets creators put their text over their videos and have a Siri-like voice read it out loud.</p><p>TikTok’s text-to-speech feature was added to make the platform accessible to more people by providing an easy way for text to be heard as well as read. Consequently, using this option in video creation is one way that content creators can ensure their videos appeal to a larger number of viewers, while also offering a more comprehensive experience in general.</p><p>Since its launch, the feature has been going viral. Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content. Also, it is a great way to get a message across without actually speaking during the video. No matter the reason it is used, the fact that many are turning to text-to-speech makes it a great addition to TikTok.</p><p>Wondering how to get the text to speech on TikTok for your next video? Here’s a detailed insight into this new feature.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?"></a>Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</h2><p>In December 2020, TikTok began rolling out a new text-to-speech feature that automatically turns text into a voiceover as users watch videos that have the feature enabled. The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.</p><p>Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/text-to-speech-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="text-to-speech tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: dexerto.com</p><p>There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.</p><p>Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.</p><p>Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?"></a>Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</h2><p>Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.</p><p>The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.</p><p>The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?"></a>Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</h2><p>Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok?

There are many memes, and they keep increasing without showing declining signs. Every good content liked, and viral will always have <strong>TikTok anime memes</strong>.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, we stayed indoors for almost a year. That has given people a chance to utilize social media differently, with memes being the most common. So far, we cannot manage to control what people will write about in their memes. Therefore, we have to dance according to the moves as well.</p><p>Here’s a list of the craziest and funniest memes trending on TikTok in 2021. Check them out:</p><p><strong>1. Da Vicky</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Da-Vinky.jpg"                      alt="da vinkytiktok meme"                ></p><p>In September, a set of Hungarian-Canadian twins were busy watching a movie. As expected, they responded in unison to a proverb about the one who painted the Mona Lisa that popped up on the screen. Instead of saying Da Vinci, the guys yelled loudly, “Da Vicky?” The video went viral, with the views skyrocketing to 2.4 million on TikTok alone.</p><p><strong>2. It’s corona time</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/corona-time.jpg"                      alt="its tiktok time tiktok meme"                ></p><p>The pandemic was transformed into a meme by featuring someone in 1985. The guy goes on to inform people that it is time for the pandemic. He keeps repeating the words as if others are not aware of the situation around him. The video was so funny and liked by many people.</p><p><strong>3. But I’m shy</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/But-Im-shy.jpg"                      alt="but I am shy tiktok meme"                ></p><p>You can’t stop laughing when you come across this video of an overwhelmed character with timidity. The actor keeps turning the index fingers and brushes cosplayers. And, you might consider using this <strong>TikTok anime meme</strong> in your captions.</p><p><strong>4. Hand gesturing TikTok meme</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Hand-gesture-TikTok.jpg"                      alt="hand gesture tiktok meme"                ></p><p>The video has been viewed for a long time but became more prevalent towards the end of 2019 and 2021. The beginning of the video seems boring but has a captivating ending. A character is punching himself, which adds humor to the video. Three-hand signals are used as timers, making it more interesting because it is impossible to have three hands.</p><p><strong>5. Point–of–views</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/povs.jpg"                      alt="povstiktok meme"                ></p><p>These are videos that target the audience to be the main character. The producers of the video give their opinions from a personal perspective. They mainly encourage, earn and teach new behavior in people.

But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!</p><p>The reason?</p><p>Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!</p><p>This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.</p><p>So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?</p><p>To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.</p><p>And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.</p><h2 id="Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright"><a href="#Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?"></a><strong>Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?</strong></h2><p>To avoid getting banned!</p><p>You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.</p><p>The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.</p><p>If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.</p><p>To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.</p><p>But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?</p><p>Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading"><a href="#Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading" class="headerlink" title="Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading"></a><strong>Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading</strong></h2><p>Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it.

The lengthier the video is, the more the loading time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stitch-option-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="stitch option tiktok video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When it’s finished, you’ll be sent to a screen where you may take five seconds of the film and use it on your own. To navigate through the movie, use the sliders and the red bars to choose the portion you want. When you’re finished, tap <strong>Next</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stitch-trim-video-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="stitch trim video tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You’ll be sent to TikTok’s normal recording screen. <strong>Record</strong> the remainder of your TikTok video with all of the features you’re accustomed to utilizing. You may use whatever effects, stickers, texts, voiceovers, or captions you desire. After that, press the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stitch-video-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="stitch video on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Make a title and hashtags for your TikTok video. You could also choose whether or not these users may Stitch your movie here – hit the toggle switch beside <strong>Allow Stitch</strong> to turn it off. Following that, hit the <strong>Post</strong> option, and your stitched video will be uploaded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-stitched-video-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="post stitched video tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Stitch-Any-TikTok-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Stitch-Any-TikTok-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Stitch Any TikTok Video with Filmora Video Editor?"></a>Part 4: How to Stitch Any TikTok Video with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</h2><p>Before getting started, understand why people opt for Filmora video editor for stitching videos on TikTok when this can be done through the official TikTok application. TikTok app only allows you to stitch a video for up to five seconds which is quite frustrating if you wish to stitch an entire video.</p><p>One more reason is that, with TikTok, you cannot stitch the already existing video from the camera roll, which restricts creators from adding the already edited content to the existing video. So, to avoid the above problems, Filmora is used for stitching TikTok videos.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>To begin, download the video that you wish to stitch with from TikTok. After, follow the below stepwise guide:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Filmora software on your PC and import the video files by clicking on the <strong>File</strong> and then <strong>Import&#x2F;Export Media</strong>. You can simply drag and drop the videos as well.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag the clips from the media library to the Timeline’s video track. All video files will be stitched into a single video with no transitions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stitch-video-filmora.jpg"                      alt="stitch video filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add a transition to the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, go to the <strong>Transition tab</strong> and drop the desired transition to the junction of two clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-stitched-video-filmora.jpg"                      alt="add transitions to stitched video filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, preview the stitched video and, when finished, click the <strong>Export</strong> option to save numerous video segments to a single file.

The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube.

The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2.

Such provisions have stirred fierce competition among influencers, for what seems like the Wars of Creativity to publish more and more viral-worthy videos.</p><p>If you are an influencer looking for new and amazing <strong>TikTok ideas</strong> to make your videos go viral, then here is a stimulus.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TikTok vs YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</a></li></ul><h2 id="TikTok-vs-YouTube-3"><a href="#TikTok-vs-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs YouTube"></a>TikTok vs YouTube</h2><p>TikTok may be one of a kind, but it is not the only platform where you can publish your mobile-made videos without much ado. The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.</p><h4 id="Nature-of-Content-3"><a href="#Nature-of-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="Nature of Content"></a>Nature of Content</h4><p>The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.</p><h4 id="User-Base-3"><a href="#User-Base-3" class="headerlink" title="User Base"></a>User Base</h4><p>TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.</p><h4 id="Outreach-3"><a href="#Outreach-3" class="headerlink" title="Outreach"></a>Outreach</h4><p>TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one’s talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.</p><p>Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.</p><h2 id="Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers-3"><a href="#Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers"></a>Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</h2><h4 id="1-Music-Videos-3"><a href="#1-Music-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Music Videos"></a>1. Music Videos</h4><p>A common theme of most viral TikTok videos is they tend to be cute and cuddly. As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos-3"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Dance Videos"></a>2. Dance Videos</h4><p>If it is short, funny, and uses the correct hashtags, your dance video can create a lot of influence among your followers. Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.</p><p>This is a good example of what <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/" >your dance video should look like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Now isn’t that the perfect ingredient for the next viral meme on the market!</p><h4 id="3-Calming-Videos-3"><a href="#3-Calming-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Calming Videos"></a>3. Calming Videos</h4><p>Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.</p><p>Look at this video of <a class="link"   href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/" >color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Did that not calm your mind?</p><h4 id="4-Objects-Singing-Videos-3"><a href="#4-Objects-Singing-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Objects Singing Videos"></a>4. Objects Singing Videos</h4><p>One of the viral TikTok memes had several objects singing Adele’s hit number “ Someone Like You”. This could be something for you to base your ideas on for a new viral video. Use any object around the house, not even necessary that it should move about. The trick lies in finding the right song to pair with, something that will lend a soul to the object and give the impression of the performance coming from a real person.</p><p>See if <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1079418894538940418" >Pikachu and his orchestra can provide you with some inspiration <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Art-Videos-3"><a href="#5-Art-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

The social media platform has many takers for such videos that show the process behind every creative job as it helps give a view into the thought process of an artist, however minute. This is also a good way for you to promote your work on social media, helping you gain greater exposure in the long run.

While fitting in the entire video into a matter of a few seconds can prove difficult, it is certainly not impossible. Skip the commentary and speed up the videos but make sure they are of self-explanatory nature. If cooking is not your thing, you can also post videos of what you eat every day – there is a sizable follower base for that category as well!</p><p>Chef Shereen will show you <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cookingwithshereen/video/6841303083289464070" >how to cook a Santa Claus Melon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here</p><h4 id="7-Animal-Videos-3"><a href="#7-Animal-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

The music needs to be as adorable as the pets themselves and make sure they are at ease doing what you ask them to do. The more authentic the reaction, the more attention your video will get. Use the shots where you get the sincerest reactions to come up with the most interesting clips.</p><p>Just look at this <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLCv72DpcY/" >adorable little doggo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="8-Funny-TikTok-Ideas-3"><a href="#8-Funny-TikTok-Ideas-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

Love for the environment, gender diversity, anti-racism, are some of the genres you can work with. The more resounding your message, the more will be the views it generates. Ensure your new lyrics are in tune with the overall tempo of the song and focus on keeping it positive.</p><p>Here is someone <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1081608132382609413" >promoting respect for women <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="10-Challenges-3"><a href="#10-Challenges-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

The presence of users having the power to choose what to post has significantly contributed to its growth. During the first quarter, it gained 350 million downloads. Currently, it boasts of having more than 800 million active users globally. However, it continues to grow and is overtaking contemporary applications like Instagram.</p><p>TikTok is a social media platform that is easily accessible from mobile phones. Besides its easy accessibility, it is a platform where content creators reach out to the entire world by uploading short videos. Brands have utilized its features like TikTok Ads Manager to market their services. This article elaborates everything about <strong>TikTok advertising</strong>: reaching your target audience using ads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok ads"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Why does TikTok Advertising Matter?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">What are Types of TikTok Ads?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Learn from 5 Best TikTok Ad Examples?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How to Run Ads on TikTok?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">Make Your TikTok Ads Attractive with Filmora</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-does-TikTok-Advertising-Matter"><a href="#Part-1-Why-does-TikTok-Advertising-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why does TikTok Advertising Matter?"></a>Part 1: Why does TikTok Advertising Matter?</h2><h3 id="1-The-current-generation-dominates-the-entire-platform"><a href="#1-The-current-generation-dominates-the-entire-platform" class="headerlink" title="1. The current generation dominates the entire platform"></a>1. The current generation dominates the entire platform</h3><p>As the statement suggests, most TikTok users are teens and young adults. According to research, it is the largest population and has a considerable purchasing power of over $140 billion. Currently known as Generation Z, it also consists of the largest population in the United States and other countries in the world. These statistics imply that your business can grow when you invest in targeting this audience. Therefore, use TikTok Ads Manager to market your business here. As expected, you will collect more revenue from TikTok users.</p><h3 id="2-High-engagement-rate-on-TikTok"><a href="#2-High-engagement-rate-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="2. High engagement rate on TikTok"></a>2. High engagement rate on TikTok</h3><p>Surprisingly, TikTok has overtaken so many leading brands like Facebookregarding time spent by users. Over 70% of users in the United States and the UK spend more time on TikTok than Facebook. Advertising on TikTok always increases the engagement rate required for your business. Consequently, many companies have taken advantage of that and benefited more than they had on other platforms. Some startling facts?</p><p>Young adults’ average time on Facebook is 58.5 minutes, while TikTok consumes 1 hour and 20 minutes of their time every day. Do you know what that means? More people will encounter your products and services on TikTok than on any social media platform. The more significant number of viewers leads to a larger market to get more clients.</p><h3 id="3-Advertising-on-TikTok-gets-your-video-to-be-viewed-by-many"><a href="#3-Advertising-on-TikTok-gets-your-video-to-be-viewed-by-many" class="headerlink" title="3.

About 93% of brands have gained many customers by using social media. Advertising your products on social media platforms allows you to reach a wider audience than other ways of communication. Most of the people are members of various social media groups.

Slowly you will find your way out and end up surpassing the branded “marketing experts.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-Types-of-TikTok-Ads"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-Types-of-TikTok-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?"></a>Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?</h2><p>We have been stressing about types of TikTok ads, and now they are. There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.</p><p><strong>1. In-Feed Ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok in feed ads"                ></p><p>These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!</p><p>A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.</p><p><strong>2. Brand Takeover ads</strong></p><p>These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the “For You” section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client’s interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That’s not just interesting. It’s because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.</p><p><strong>3. Top View ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-top-view-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok top view ads"                ></p><p>These cover the first post in the “<strong>Feeds</strong>“ section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience’s attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That’s where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.</p><p><strong>4. Branded hashtags ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok hashtags ads"                ></p><p>Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.</p><p>This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.</p><p>Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That’s the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.</p><p><strong>5. Branded effects ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-effects-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok effects ads"                ></p><p>Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Learn-from-5-Best-TikTok-Ad-Examples"><a href="#Part-3-Learn-from-5-Best-TikTok-Ad-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Learn from 5 Best TikTok Ad Examples"></a>Part 3: Learn from 5 Best TikTok Ad Examples</h2><h3 id="1-Acome"><a href="#1-Acome" class="headerlink" title="1.

The campaign contained videos on students displaying what they had bought from the company. A hashtag also accompanied the ad to promote more services like stationery and bedding equipment necessary for students. The ad generated a lot of organic traffic, boosting its SEO ranking in SERPs by garnering more than 3 million views, 252000 likes, and 1k comments and shares.</p><h3 id="3-Guess"><a href="#3-Guess" class="headerlink" title="3. Guess"></a>3. Guess</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-ads-guess.jpg"                      alt="guess"                ></p><p>Guess specializes in a lucrative business that supplies clothes among the United States’ teens and the youth. Creating a hashtag that displays the youth’s luxurious fashion styles gave them an upper hand over other companies. The engagement rate increased spontaneously with an additional 14.3% click-through rate and gaining 12k new subscribers by partnering with some TikTok marketing agencies.</p><h3 id="4-Gusher"><a href="#4-Gusher" class="headerlink" title="4. Gusher"></a>4. Gusher</h3><p>Gusher is a candy business that uses TikTok ads to access a broader audience to taste their candies. The first attempt to create a TikTok ad gained new 5 million views. That motivated them to continue using ads that have propelled their business by skyrocketing their purchasing power. TikTok ads have done miracles for many companies, and Gusher is no exception.</p><h3 id="5-Ralph-Lauren"><a href="#5-Ralph-Lauren" class="headerlink" title="5. Ralph Lauren"></a>5. Ralph Lauren</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-ads-ralph-lauren.jpg"                      alt="ralph lauren"                ></p><p>This was a TikTok ad created to market the clothing business of Ralph Lauren. Did it also use hashtags? Yes, but there was something extra. The company used a social media influencer, Diana Silvers, an actress. Usually, everyone would always want to listen to what celebrities are saying.</p><p>The fact that Diana was an actress made the company get recognized. Clients were allowed to make direct purchases just by using a few clicks—the number of customers received that month was tremendous. Increased sales and handling many customers was the talk of the day. It allowed users to access the company directly led to the company using email marketing techniques because of the emails saved during the online purchasing process.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Run-Ads-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Run-Ads-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Run Ads on TikTok?"></a>Part 4: How to Run Ads on TikTok?</h2><p>Creating and running adverts on TikTok should not be difficult. The app has a straightforward way of doing it. Whether you have a small business like a freelancer, you will need to advertise it for direct clients. To use ads, go to the dashboard and select the “Campaign” tab, located at the top. Pick from the available sections from the tab depending on your marketing preferences. You are at liberty to choose from traffic, app installs, and conversions.</p><p>Before you begin advertising, have some cash to purchase the ad for as little as $10 for a successful TikTok campaign.

There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.</p><p><strong>1. In-Feed Ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok in feed ads"                ></p><p>These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!</p><p>A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.</p><p><strong>2. Brand Takeover ads</strong></p><p>These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the “For You” section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client’s interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That’s not just interesting. It’s because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.</p><p><strong>3. Top View ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-top-view-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok top view ads"                ></p><p>These cover the first post in the “<strong>Feeds</strong>“ section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience’s attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That’s where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.</p><p><strong>4. Branded hashtags ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok hashtags ads"                ></p><p>Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.</p><p>This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.</p><p>Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That’s the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.</p><p><strong>5. Branded effects ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-effects-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok effects ads"                ></p><p>Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Learn-from-5-Best-TikTok-Ad-Examples-1"><a href="#Part-3-Learn-from-5-Best-TikTok-Ad-Examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Learn from 5 Best TikTok Ad Examples"></a>Part 3: Learn from 5 Best TikTok Ad Examples</h2><h3 id="1-Acome-1"><a href="#1-Acome-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Let’s check them out:</p><p><strong>Know your budget and target audience</strong> –The first thing considered should be the amount to spend on buying ads. Also, know who should access the information. Are you targeting teens? Gamers? Students or whoever you wish to target, tell them how you will serve them and why you should serve them.</p><p><strong>Upload a new video</strong>. Let the video that you select be original. It should be new so that people find it fascinating. No one would enjoy watching something that has been around for long.</p><p><strong>Add text to your videos</strong>. The text communicates more information than just video. A call-to-action will do better because readers will get prompted to take immediate action- a TikTok campaign idea that has worked for the leading brands that boast of their many clients.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>To sum up, TikTok is an excellent platform to market your business by ads.

But how exactly can you do that? Well, don’t miss some essential points to become the mostfamous TikToker mentioned below.</p><h3 id="1-Take-a-video-with-a-trending-song-or-audio"><a href="#1-Take-a-video-with-a-trending-song-or-audio" class="headerlink" title="1. Take a video with a trending song or audio"></a>1. Take a video with a trending song or audio</h3><p>First, you have to know what’s trending on the internet. It might not work out for you if you rarely spend time on what is happening worldwide. It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don’t have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, “The Whoa” track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.</p><h3 id="2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags"><a href="#2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags"></a>2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags</h3><p>Sometimes you will come across a hashtag which is not even related to what you want to post. Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list. For instance, a dance by Marilyn Monroe had many hashtags like #keepingitbusy, #shareyourplaylist, and others that were not even related to the contents of the video.</p><p>Funny enough, the video went viral and gained over 200 followers. Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video. But don’t forget to include some that depict your post’s content to avoid making it too irrelevant.</p><h3 id="3-Maintain-your-theme"><a href="#3-Maintain-your-theme" class="headerlink" title="3. Maintain your theme"></a>3. Maintain your theme</h3><p>Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don’t keep on mixing themes.</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video"><a href="#4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video" class="headerlink" title="4.

For you to stand out, make sure everything is close to perfect if it’s not perfect, and we’d like to recommend Wondershare Filmora to extract the most outstanding features out of the TikTok video.

But how exactly can you do that? Well, don’t miss some essential points to become the mostfamous TikToker mentioned below.</p><h3 id="1-Take-a-video-with-a-trending-song-or-audio-1"><a href="#1-Take-a-video-with-a-trending-song-or-audio-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Take a video with a trending song or audio"></a>1. Take a video with a trending song or audio</h3><p>First, you have to know what’s trending on the internet. It might not work out for you if you rarely spend time on what is happening worldwide. It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don’t have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, “The Whoa” track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.</p><h3 id="2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags-1"><a href="#2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list. For instance, a dance by Marilyn Monroe had many hashtags like #keepingitbusy, #shareyourplaylist, and others that were not even related to the contents of the video.</p><p>Funny enough, the video went viral and gained over 200 followers. Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video. But don’t forget to include some that depict your post’s content to avoid making it too irrelevant.</p><h3 id="3-Maintain-your-theme-1"><a href="#3-Maintain-your-theme-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Maintain your theme"></a>3. Maintain your theme</h3><p>Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don’t keep on mixing themes.</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-1"><a href="#4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list. For instance, a dance by Marilyn Monroe had many hashtags like #keepingitbusy, #shareyourplaylist, and others that were not even related to the contents of the video.</p><p>Funny enough, the video went viral and gained over 200 followers. Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video.

Don’t keep on mixing themes.</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-3"><a href="#4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

Move the human segmentation effect to the video timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-human-segmentation-filmora.jpg"                      alt="add human segmentation to remove tiktok video background"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Adjust the Effect Setting (Optional)</strong></p><p>In the preview window, you’ll notice that the subject has been separated from the video background. If necessary, double-click the video in the timeline and find the video effect field to modify the edge, thickness, and feather. You can also try the neon borders and glowing flow effects under the AI Portrait category to have some fun.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-human-segmentation-setting.jpg"                      alt="adjust human segmentation in Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Change the Background</strong></p><p>Now, drop the background video to the track below the video clip to change the video background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-background-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="change tiktok video background in Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Export the video with new background</strong></p><p>Preview the final result and then click the Export button to save the video on your computer.</p><p>Note: Check this guide to find out <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>how to upload TikTok videos on your desktop</em></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>To lure the viewer’s attention, there is always a necessity to create visual and audio effects in a TikTok video.
