Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.</p><p><strong>Discord music bots</strong> provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora box"                ></p><p>Filmora Discord Video Editor</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora - Discord Video Editor"></a>Wondershare Filmora - Discord Video Editor</h4><p>• Create videos for Discord with a smaller size due to the 8MB restriction</p><p>• Edit audio files like denoise, crop, audio ducking, audio auto synchronization, etc…</p><p>• Cross-platform supported - (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord"></a>Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord</h2><h3 id="1-Probot"><a href="#1-Probot" class="headerlink" title="1.

Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.</p><p>This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.</p><p>Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.</p><p>After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list.

Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.</p><p><strong>Discord music bots</strong> provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora box"                ></p><p>Filmora Discord Video Editor</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora - Discord Video Editor"></a>Wondershare Filmora - Discord Video Editor</h4><p>• Create videos for Discord with a smaller size due to the 8MB restriction</p><p>• Edit audio files like denoise, crop, audio ducking, audio auto synchronization, etc…</p><p>• Cross-platform supported - (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord-1"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord"></a>Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord</h2><h3 id="1-Probot-1"><a href="#1-Probot-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Just go to the Website of whatever Music Bot you wish to add. Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.</p><p>This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.</p><p>Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.</p><p>After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list.

Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.</p><p><strong>Discord music bots</strong> provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora box"                ></p><p>Filmora Discord Video Editor</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora - Discord Video Editor"></a>Wondershare Filmora - Discord Video Editor</h4><p>• Create videos for Discord with a smaller size due to the 8MB restriction</p><p>• Edit audio files like denoise, crop, audio ducking, audio auto synchronization, etc…</p><p>• Cross-platform supported - (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord-2"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord"></a>Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord</h2><h3 id="1-Probot-2"><a href="#1-Probot-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

Then all you need to do is click on the “Add to Discord” Button.</p><p>This will then take you to a page where it will ask for a server to enter and also list other things it’ll gain access to.</p><p>Just choose the server you wish to add the bot to from the drop-down menu and click continue.</p><p>After that, you’ll have to prove your humanity and that’s all. The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-2"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list.

Discord servers are like a big group chat but with many more features. Music Bots allow users to listen to music while they play games or just chat with their friends. Discord Bots are created like a virtual Discord user. To listen to music you have to join a voice channel and then run a command specific to that bot to make it join the voice channel and start playing music.</p><p><strong>Discord music bots</strong> provide a way for multiple members of a server to listen to the same music at the same time. Discord music bots can find songs on YouTube, Spotify, or other platforms and play them on a Discord voice channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora box"                ></p><p>Filmora Discord Video Editor</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-Discord-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora - Discord Video Editor"></a>Wondershare Filmora - Discord Video Editor</h4><p>• Create videos for Discord with a smaller size due to the 8MB restriction</p><p>• Edit audio files like denoise, crop, audio ducking, audio auto synchronization, etc…</p><p>• Cross-platform supported - (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Discord Music &amp; Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord-3"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Best-High-Quality-Music-Bots-For-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord"></a>Part 2: Top 10 Best High-Quality Music Bots For Discord</h2><h3 id="1-Probot-3"><a href="#1-Probot-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

The bot has now been added to your selected server. You can find it in the members’ area to the right. If there is no member area then just click the Members tab at the top right corner of the screen to view all the members on the server.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Play-Music-on-Discord-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?"></a>Part 4: How to Play Music on Discord?</h2><p>Playing music on discord using a bot is as easy as pie. All you have to do is go to the website of your specific bot and look up the commands. In this example, we would be using Groovy Bot.</p><p>Another way to check commands is through your discord server. Type <em>–help</em> for Groovy and similarly for every other bot ([specified prefix]help). It will then state how you can check the commands for that bot.</p><p>Then in your Discord server after joining a voice channel, the type that commands with a link to a piece of music or the name (-play i dont think i love u anymore) if your bot allows that and the bot will join the voice channel and start streaming music.</p><p>You can also loop the song currently playing by typing the <em>–loop track</em> command. And loop your whole queue using –<em>loop queue</em>. You can turn the loop off by –<em>loop off</em>.</p><p>If you want to add another song to a queue, just use the same play command and Groovy will add that song next in the list. You can view your queue using the <em>–queue</em> command.</p><p>In the end no matter what bot you choose, it doesn’t matter as long as you have fun and love the features it provides. There are a lot more bots out there but in my opinion, these are the best, most famous, and most trustworthy providing the best music playback quality.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes-3"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Create-Videos-for-Discord-in-Minutes-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?"></a>Bonus: How to Create Videos for Discord in Minutes?</h2><p>Since it is not allowed to upload files of more than 8MB on Discord, you need an perfect video tool for making videos in less size, it is better for you to use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmore Discord video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to share original music and videos on Discord in compressed size.

The platform is best for sponsored placements and can only sell 1,000 followers at a particular point in time. This is not a drawback to increasing your account’s following, as you can still buy followers separately over some time until you reach your desired following.

However, it’s perhaps one of the primary viral dances to break out of the app’s confines itself and influence multiple other TikTokers to strive to be trending all over.</p><p>You need to understand the anatomy of this TikTok 2022 dance going famous along with its strategies to know how a TikTok dance can become popular around the globe.</p><p>The original dance was by Atlanta-based 14-year-old Jalaiah Harmon in September 2019 and promptly fueled up with middle and high school students. Given the song “Lottery” by K Camp, Harmon’s dance has been observed in talent shows and at school pep rallies for TikTok competitions.</p><p>Here’s a girl named Kara Leigh Cannella, who is a senior dance major at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia</p><p>She was scrolling through TikTok one day this fall when she came across a sound that grabbed her attention. It was called HOOPLA, a 15-second clip by the user known as @kyleyoumadethat, and it promptly made her wish to dance.</p><p>She began by improvising, as she often does while choreographing for TikTok. Between famous moves like the Woah and the Wave, she mimed releasing a basketball into the air and dribbling it between her legs, reflecting sound themes (which samples the song “Basketball” 2002 Lil Bow Wow).</p><p>“Then I cleaned up the moves,” she says, “because I was like, ‘I don’t want to make this too hard.’ “</p><p>Cannella, 22, had struck an excellent balance for TikTok dance virality though she was not aware of it yet: something rhythmically satisfying and eye-catching but still accessible, not beyond the real amateur dancers. She showed the dance in her bathroom and posted it with a call to “try it and tag me.”</p><p>To her surprise, by the following day, the video received 10,000 likes, and soon the dance was all around the TikTok platform, also tried by the app’s most-followed user, a 16-year-old dancer, Charli D’Amelio. She posted it for her then-95 million followers.</p><p>So, this was the overall pick behind popular TikTok dances 2022, which you can observe that there’s no such rocket science in letting dance become highly trending.</p><p>Dance has always found a social media audience, but TikTok, more so than other platforms, has given a boom to its own highly recognizable, simply reproducible style.</p><p>Being inspired from a lexicon of hip-hop–inspired moves—like the Dougie, Throw It Back, and the Dice Roll, to name just a few—the micro TikTok dance songs 2022 are generally front-facing most animated from the hips up.</p><p>They specifically cater to the smartphone screen vertical frame. Governed by time limits between 15 to 60 seconds, they also tend to preserve in a single place; you can do them anywhere pretty much.</p><p>While many professional dancers display their hard-earned TikTok skills, the app, globally released in 2018, has become recognized as a space where everyone is for dance.</p><p>“It’s not about having the perfect dance body; it doesn’t matter if you’re a pro,” says Alessandro Bogliari, the Influencer Marketing Factory’s CEO, a company that ramps within SMM campaigns. “It’s about re-creating and having certain funny moves.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024"><a href="#Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024"></a>Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024</h2><p>What does it take to get mentioned as a dancer regarding popular TikTok dances 2022?

However, it’s perhaps one of the primary viral dances to break out of the app’s confines itself and influence multiple other TikTokers to strive to be trending all over.</p><p>You need to understand the anatomy of this TikTok 2022 dance going famous along with its strategies to know how a TikTok dance can become popular around the globe.</p><p>The original dance was by Atlanta-based 14-year-old Jalaiah Harmon in September 2019 and promptly fueled up with middle and high school students. Given the song “Lottery” by K Camp, Harmon’s dance has been observed in talent shows and at school pep rallies for TikTok competitions.</p><p>Here’s a girl named Kara Leigh Cannella, who is a senior dance major at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia</p><p>She was scrolling through TikTok one day this fall when she came across a sound that grabbed her attention. It was called HOOPLA, a 15-second clip by the user known as @kyleyoumadethat, and it promptly made her wish to dance.</p><p>She began by improvising, as she often does while choreographing for TikTok. Between famous moves like the Woah and the Wave, she mimed releasing a basketball into the air and dribbling it between her legs, reflecting sound themes (which samples the song “Basketball” 2002 Lil Bow Wow).</p><p>“Then I cleaned up the moves,” she says, “because I was like, ‘I don’t want to make this too hard.’ “</p><p>Cannella, 22, had struck an excellent balance for TikTok dance virality though she was not aware of it yet: something rhythmically satisfying and eye-catching but still accessible, not beyond the real amateur dancers. She showed the dance in her bathroom and posted it with a call to “try it and tag me.”</p><p>To her surprise, by the following day, the video received 10,000 likes, and soon the dance was all around the TikTok platform, also tried by the app’s most-followed user, a 16-year-old dancer, Charli D’Amelio. She posted it for her then-95 million followers.</p><p>So, this was the overall pick behind popular TikTok dances 2022, which you can observe that there’s no such rocket science in letting dance become highly trending.</p><p>Dance has always found a social media audience, but TikTok, more so than other platforms, has given a boom to its own highly recognizable, simply reproducible style.</p><p>Being inspired from a lexicon of hip-hop–inspired moves—like the Dougie, Throw It Back, and the Dice Roll, to name just a few—the micro TikTok dance songs 2022 are generally front-facing most animated from the hips up.</p><p>They specifically cater to the smartphone screen vertical frame. Governed by time limits between 15 to 60 seconds, they also tend to preserve in a single place; you can do them anywhere pretty much.</p><p>While many professional dancers display their hard-earned TikTok skills, the app, globally released in 2018, has become recognized as a space where everyone is for dance.</p><p>“It’s not about having the perfect dance body; it doesn’t matter if you’re a pro,” says Alessandro Bogliari, the Influencer Marketing Factory’s CEO, a company that ramps within SMM campaigns. “It’s about re-creating and having certain funny moves.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024-1"><a href="#Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024"></a>Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024</h2><p>What does it take to get mentioned as a dancer regarding popular TikTok dances 2022?

However, it’s perhaps one of the primary viral dances to break out of the app’s confines itself and influence multiple other TikTokers to strive to be trending all over.</p><p>You need to understand the anatomy of this TikTok 2022 dance going famous along with its strategies to know how a TikTok dance can become popular around the globe.</p><p>The original dance was by Atlanta-based 14-year-old Jalaiah Harmon in September 2019 and promptly fueled up with middle and high school students. Given the song “Lottery” by K Camp, Harmon’s dance has been observed in talent shows and at school pep rallies for TikTok competitions.</p><p>Here’s a girl named Kara Leigh Cannella, who is a senior dance major at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia</p><p>She was scrolling through TikTok one day this fall when she came across a sound that grabbed her attention. It was called HOOPLA, a 15-second clip by the user known as @kyleyoumadethat, and it promptly made her wish to dance.</p><p>She began by improvising, as she often does while choreographing for TikTok. Between famous moves like the Woah and the Wave, she mimed releasing a basketball into the air and dribbling it between her legs, reflecting sound themes (which samples the song “Basketball” 2002 Lil Bow Wow).</p><p>“Then I cleaned up the moves,” she says, “because I was like, ‘I don’t want to make this too hard.’ “</p><p>Cannella, 22, had struck an excellent balance for TikTok dance virality though she was not aware of it yet: something rhythmically satisfying and eye-catching but still accessible, not beyond the real amateur dancers. She showed the dance in her bathroom and posted it with a call to “try it and tag me.”</p><p>To her surprise, by the following day, the video received 10,000 likes, and soon the dance was all around the TikTok platform, also tried by the app’s most-followed user, a 16-year-old dancer, Charli D’Amelio. She posted it for her then-95 million followers.</p><p>So, this was the overall pick behind popular TikTok dances 2022, which you can observe that there’s no such rocket science in letting dance become highly trending.</p><p>Dance has always found a social media audience, but TikTok, more so than other platforms, has given a boom to its own highly recognizable, simply reproducible style.</p><p>Being inspired from a lexicon of hip-hop–inspired moves—like the Dougie, Throw It Back, and the Dice Roll, to name just a few—the micro TikTok dance songs 2022 are generally front-facing most animated from the hips up.</p><p>They specifically cater to the smartphone screen vertical frame. Governed by time limits between 15 to 60 seconds, they also tend to preserve in a single place; you can do them anywhere pretty much.</p><p>While many professional dancers display their hard-earned TikTok skills, the app, globally released in 2018, has become recognized as a space where everyone is for dance.</p><p>“It’s not about having the perfect dance body; it doesn’t matter if you’re a pro,” says Alessandro Bogliari, the Influencer Marketing Factory’s CEO, a company that ramps within SMM campaigns. “It’s about re-creating and having certain funny moves.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024-2"><a href="#Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024"></a>Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024</h2><p>What does it take to get mentioned as a dancer regarding popular TikTok dances 2022?

However, it’s perhaps one of the primary viral dances to break out of the app’s confines itself and influence multiple other TikTokers to strive to be trending all over.</p><p>You need to understand the anatomy of this TikTok 2022 dance going famous along with its strategies to know how a TikTok dance can become popular around the globe.</p><p>The original dance was by Atlanta-based 14-year-old Jalaiah Harmon in September 2019 and promptly fueled up with middle and high school students. Given the song “Lottery” by K Camp, Harmon’s dance has been observed in talent shows and at school pep rallies for TikTok competitions.</p><p>Here’s a girl named Kara Leigh Cannella, who is a senior dance major at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia</p><p>She was scrolling through TikTok one day this fall when she came across a sound that grabbed her attention. It was called HOOPLA, a 15-second clip by the user known as @kyleyoumadethat, and it promptly made her wish to dance.</p><p>She began by improvising, as she often does while choreographing for TikTok. Between famous moves like the Woah and the Wave, she mimed releasing a basketball into the air and dribbling it between her legs, reflecting sound themes (which samples the song “Basketball” 2002 Lil Bow Wow).</p><p>“Then I cleaned up the moves,” she says, “because I was like, ‘I don’t want to make this too hard.’ “</p><p>Cannella, 22, had struck an excellent balance for TikTok dance virality though she was not aware of it yet: something rhythmically satisfying and eye-catching but still accessible, not beyond the real amateur dancers. She showed the dance in her bathroom and posted it with a call to “try it and tag me.”</p><p>To her surprise, by the following day, the video received 10,000 likes, and soon the dance was all around the TikTok platform, also tried by the app’s most-followed user, a 16-year-old dancer, Charli D’Amelio. She posted it for her then-95 million followers.</p><p>So, this was the overall pick behind popular TikTok dances 2022, which you can observe that there’s no such rocket science in letting dance become highly trending.</p><p>Dance has always found a social media audience, but TikTok, more so than other platforms, has given a boom to its own highly recognizable, simply reproducible style.</p><p>Being inspired from a lexicon of hip-hop–inspired moves—like the Dougie, Throw It Back, and the Dice Roll, to name just a few—the micro TikTok dance songs 2022 are generally front-facing most animated from the hips up.</p><p>They specifically cater to the smartphone screen vertical frame. Governed by time limits between 15 to 60 seconds, they also tend to preserve in a single place; you can do them anywhere pretty much.</p><p>While many professional dancers display their hard-earned TikTok skills, the app, globally released in 2018, has become recognized as a space where everyone is for dance.</p><p>“It’s not about having the perfect dance body; it doesn’t matter if you’re a pro,” says Alessandro Bogliari, the Influencer Marketing Factory’s CEO, a company that ramps within SMM campaigns. “It’s about re-creating and having certain funny moves.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024-3"><a href="#Part-2-15-Trending-TikTok-Dances-in-2024-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024"></a>Part 2: 15 Trending TikTok Dances in 2024</h2><p>What does it take to get mentioned as a dancer regarding popular TikTok dances 2022?

The first among these is the place where you write your bio and enter your username in the application. Here, you can simply cut and paste any text you want. This includes the text you create using a TikTok fonts generator. On the other hand, the second is more complex. It is where you can add text as an overlay to the short videos you create using this application. You can add text to the video only after you shoot your video footage, i.e. – in the second stage of your video creation.</p><p>To start the video-creation process, click on the + icon located in the center bottom of your TikTok app. This will bring up the camera view. It is here that you will record the video clips and make some adjustments.</p><p>The next stage is where you need to make some fundamental decisions like if you will take videos using the app’s camera or whether you will be uploading other video clips. Also, you have to decide if you will use the flash and if you will record by setting a timer or pushing the big Record button.</p><p>Even though the video record screen will allow you to set a few creative options like adding effects, filters, and music to the video you are all set to record, you won’t be able to add text. You will have to record at least one video clip so that you can trim and add it together with other videos at the editing stage. It is at this editing stage that Tik Tok will provide you the opportunity to use text and customize it in your video.</p><p>Here’s how you can add and customize your text in TikTok videos-</p><p>Step-1: Click on the “Text” option (You will notice the <strong>Aa</strong> symbol above it)</p><p>Step-2: Type in the text you want in your video</p><p>Step-3: Customize your text by using the options available to you-</p><ul><li>By tapping on the <strong>A</strong> on the left side of your screen, you can highlight your text</li><li>You will be able to change the text’s font through the options listed on the text menu’s top-left side.

Keep in mind that you will be able to change the timing and placement of your text only after this point.</p><p>Step-5: Next, drag your text to the area where you want it to appear and then tap on it for more options.</p><p>Step-6: Choose <strong>Set Duration</strong> if you wish to adjust the timing of your text on the video. This will bring you to the screen where you will be able to adjust when the text appears and disappears.</p><p>Step-7: Tap on the play button situated just above the editing bar to see how your text looks.

The first among these is the place where you write your bio and enter your username in the application. Here, you can simply cut and paste any text you want. This includes the text you create using a TikTok fonts generator. On the other hand, the second is more complex. It is where you can add text as an overlay to the short videos you create using this application. You can add text to the video only after you shoot your video footage, i.e. – in the second stage of your video creation.</p><p>To start the video-creation process, click on the + icon located in the center bottom of your TikTok app. This will bring up the camera view. It is here that you will record the video clips and make some adjustments.</p><p>The next stage is where you need to make some fundamental decisions like if you will take videos using the app’s camera or whether you will be uploading other video clips. Also, you have to decide if you will use the flash and if you will record by setting a timer or pushing the big Record button.</p><p>Even though the video record screen will allow you to set a few creative options like adding effects, filters, and music to the video you are all set to record, you won’t be able to add text. You will have to record at least one video clip so that you can trim and add it together with other videos at the editing stage. It is at this editing stage that Tik Tok will provide you the opportunity to use text and customize it in your video.</p><p>Here’s how you can add and customize your text in TikTok videos-</p><p>Step-1: Click on the “Text” option (You will notice the <strong>Aa</strong> symbol above it)</p><p>Step-2: Type in the text you want in your video</p><p>Step-3: Customize your text by using the options available to you-</p><ul><li>By tapping on the <strong>A</strong> on the left side of your screen, you can highlight your text</li><li>You will be able to change the text’s font through the options listed on the text menu’s top-left side. To change the color, choose an option from the colorful circles at the screen’s bottom</li></ul><p>Step-4: when ready, click on <strong>Done</strong> on your screen’s top-right side. Keep in mind that you will be able to change the timing and placement of your text only after this point.</p><p>Step-5: Next, drag your text to the area where you want it to appear and then tap on it for more options.</p><p>Step-6: Choose <strong>Set Duration</strong> if you wish to adjust the timing of your text on the video. This will bring you to the screen where you will be able to adjust when the text appears and disappears.</p><p>Step-7: Tap on the play button situated just above the editing bar to see how your text looks. Once you are happy with it, choose the checkmark in the screen’s bottom-right corner.</p><p>Step-8: Click “Next” to simply continue in the video creation process to add a description and any other information you desire. Once done, hit <strong>Post.</strong></p><h2 id="How-do-Stylish-TikTok-Fonts-Help-You-Gain-More-Views-3"><a href="#How-do-Stylish-TikTok-Fonts-Help-You-Gain-More-Views-3" class="headerlink" title="How do Stylish TikTok Fonts Help You Gain More Views?"></a>How do Stylish TikTok Fonts Help You Gain More Views?</h2><p>As simple as it may sound, using attractive TikTok fonts can help your videos get widely recognized, thus gaining more views.

Check out below to know more.</p><p>President Donald Trump on August 5, 2020, issued executive orders announcing that he is banning Chinese-owned TikTok from U.S. app stores. The drastic move comes months after the Trump administration first teased the idea of outlawing this immensely popular video-sharing app due to national security concerns.</p><p>U.S. officials are concerned that this Chinese-owned and operated app can potentially pass on US users’ data to the Chinese government. And, with TikTok facing uncertainty in the U.S. between being banned or bought by an American company, many predict Likee may soon surpass TikTok. This has sparked the debate of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Likee Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok mired in uncertainty in the US, users are jumping to other video-sharing apps. The continual privacy concerns over TikTok may have opened the window for competitors such as Likee to try seizing the opportunity and take the social media throne. But, so far it hasn’t been successful in surpassing TikTok since the app is at least 50 million weekly active users behind TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a detailed insight on Likee vs. TikTok.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Likee"><a href="#Likee" class="headerlink" title="Likee"></a>Likee</h4><p>Launched in the year 2017, Likee allows users to create short videos easily with intuitive editing tools. Formerly known as ‘Like’, this photo and video editing app give users the freedom to experiment on their videos and photos as much as they want. Just like TikTok, Likee is a social video platform that provides several fun ways to create music videos, short videos, and recreate famous scenes from movies, as well as share funny moments with followers. The app utilizes an artificial intelligence algorithm for exact content recommendations for its users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee.png"                      alt="Likee Features"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Released in September 2016, TikTok is the most popular short-form, video-sharing app. Often referred to as a “lip-syncing” app, it gives users the freedom to create and share 15-second mobile videos on any topic. It is a fun and entertaining app that has emerged as one of the biggest marketing and social networking platforms today.</p><h2 id="Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?"></a>Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</h2><p>Likee is one of the many social-video sharing apps that have been making waves worldwide amid the privacy concerns and the ban imposed by the Trump administration on TikTok. The app is best for older teens and young adults. The app is ideal for users who love singing and dancing. Also, the app lets users star in their own music video and then share them online.</p><p>For teenagers who understand what’s apt to post in social media, can keep negative comments in perspective, and are prepared for some mature comment, Likee provides a great deal of entertainment and opportunities to show off creativity. The app has a 17+ age restriction.</p><p>Just like Likee, teenagers and younger people are the main users of TikTok. It is used by GenZ as a platform to express their creativity. According to GlobalWebIndex, about 41% of TikTok’s users are of the age group 16 to 24. A majority of TikTok’s users are content creators who wish to expand their reach through short videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-likee-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Who Uses Likee Tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences"><a href="#Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>Ever since its launch in 2016, TikTok has been growing in popularity all over the world. It is a social platform for sharing short videos. As with Likee, it is the perfect tool for creating the most amazing multimedia content that you can think of.</p><p>Both these apps are used for creating and sharing short videos on social media and are compatible with Android as well as iOS devices. Each of these apps offers a range of attractions for their young users.</p><p>With people debating on whether to stick with TikTok or switch to Likee, are you confused about what sets apart these video-sharing apps from each other? Here’s a detailed comparison of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Likee</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Headquarters</td><td>China</td><td>Singapore</td></tr><tr><td>Platform Type</td><td>TikTok is a PGC (Profession Generated Content) platform</td><td>Likee is a UGC (User Generated Content) platform</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Options</td><td>A multitude of video effects Emojis, text, frames, trimming videos, and much more</td><td>AI &amp; AR-based technology Realistic hair color filters, 4D magic, superpower effects</td></tr><tr><td>Music Options</td><td>Broad and up-to-date music catalog. Third-party apps are needed to add their own music</td><td>The built-in music library is fairly limited to TikTok. Allows users to add ‘local music’</td></tr><tr><td>Text Options</td><td>Text boxes with accurate timing and positioning. The background color is adjustable</td><td>Multiple text boxes with accurate timing. Ability to change the size, font, color, angle, and background</td></tr><tr><td>Socialization</td><td>TikTok aims to redefine digital socialization by introducing online video socialization</td><td>Likee allows user to watch live streaming and make new friends by People Nearby function</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>800 million active users worldwide</td><td>150 million monthly active users</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok"><a href="#Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Will Likee Surpass TikTok?"></a>Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</h2><p>With the whole “TikTok being banned in the US” becoming a thing, some assumed that competitors will soon surpass TikTok. However, no competitor, including Likee has been successful in doing so. Although some users switched to other video-sharing apps in panic, TikTok remains to be in the spotlight even today. Moreover, after a deal was sealed with Walmart and Oracle, it appears that TikTok will be able to continue its operations in the U.S.</p><p>Whether TikTok is really a national security concern remains unclear. But, one thing is clear - just like TikTok, Likee isn’t protected from scrutiny over apps with Chinese roots. Likee is owned by a company based in Singapore which in turn was purchased by China’s JOYI. Moreover, with India already ousting Likee along with other Chinese apps for being a threat to national security, the Trump administration isn’t far behind.</p><p>Listed below are a few major reasons TikTok will maintain its top spot and popularity amid all privacy concerns for the years to come.</p><h4 id="1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive"><a href="#1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive" class="headerlink" title="1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive"></a>1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive</h4><p>People on Facebook and Instagram might know that time flies by once they start scrolling through the news feed. But, TikTok is much more addictive than Facebook and Instagram. People on TikTok spend 55 minutes on the app on average. This is very interesting since it depicts the great potential for marketers.</p><p>Mostly, TikTok users spend their time in binge-watching videos. What makes TikTok so addictive is that the app enables users to express themselves through different creative ways.</p><h4 id="2-Native-Content-Editor"><a href="#2-Native-Content-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2.Native Content Editor"></a>2.Native Content Editor</h4><p>TikTok’s features to shoot footage, quickly trim and stitch together video clips and incorporate voice as well as music effects at the touch of a button makes it the ideal destination for every creator. When it comes to Likee vs. TikTok, what makes the trim feature of TikTok so enticing is that the app allows creators to storyboard their videos and publish their finished product.</p><h4 id="3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos"><a href="#3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos"></a>3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos</h4><p>The homepage of TikTok is much more like Twitter than Instagram or Facebook. This means that viral videos with great engagement move to the front of the line and comprise the feed. Although a “Discover” tab allows you to browse specific topics and hashtags, you are served with one video at a time.</p><p>This is a part of TikTok’s competitive advantage over Likee. With an endless number of prompts, it is easy to participate since you need not have anything interesting to talk about to get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-problem.jpg"                      alt="Tiktok Problem"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.theguardian.com/" >www.theguardian.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>No matter whether you are social media lurker or a content creator, be assured that TikTok is here to stay.

Also, the app lets users star in their own music video and then share them online.</p><p>For teenagers who understand what’s apt to post in social media, can keep negative comments in perspective, and are prepared for some mature comment, Likee provides a great deal of entertainment and opportunities to show off creativity. The app has a 17+ age restriction.</p><p>Just like Likee, teenagers and younger people are the main users of TikTok. It is used by GenZ as a platform to express their creativity. According to GlobalWebIndex, about 41% of TikTok’s users are of the age group 16 to 24. A majority of TikTok’s users are content creators who wish to expand their reach through short videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-likee-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Who Uses Likee Tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences-3"><a href="#Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences-3" class="headerlink" title="Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>Ever since its launch in 2016, TikTok has been growing in popularity all over the world. It is a social platform for sharing short videos. As with Likee, it is the perfect tool for creating the most amazing multimedia content that you can think of.</p><p>Both these apps are used for creating and sharing short videos on social media and are compatible with Android as well as iOS devices. Each of these apps offers a range of attractions for their young users.</p><p>With people debating on whether to stick with TikTok or switch to Likee, are you confused about what sets apart these video-sharing apps from each other? Here’s a detailed comparison of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Likee</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Headquarters</td><td>China</td><td>Singapore</td></tr><tr><td>Platform Type</td><td>TikTok is a PGC (Profession Generated Content) platform</td><td>Likee is a UGC (User Generated Content) platform</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Options</td><td>A multitude of video effects Emojis, text, frames, trimming videos, and much more</td><td>AI &amp; AR-based technology Realistic hair color filters, 4D magic, superpower effects</td></tr><tr><td>Music Options</td><td>Broad and up-to-date music catalog. Third-party apps are needed to add their own music</td><td>The built-in music library is fairly limited to TikTok. Allows users to add ‘local music’</td></tr><tr><td>Text Options</td><td>Text boxes with accurate timing and positioning. The background color is adjustable</td><td>Multiple text boxes with accurate timing. Ability to change the size, font, color, angle, and background</td></tr><tr><td>Socialization</td><td>TikTok aims to redefine digital socialization by introducing online video socialization</td><td>Likee allows user to watch live streaming and make new friends by People Nearby function</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>800 million active users worldwide</td><td>150 million monthly active users</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok-3"><a href="#Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="Will Likee Surpass TikTok?"></a>Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</h2><p>With the whole “TikTok being banned in the US” becoming a thing, some assumed that competitors will soon surpass TikTok. However, no competitor, including Likee has been successful in doing so. Although some users switched to other video-sharing apps in panic, TikTok remains to be in the spotlight even today. Moreover, after a deal was sealed with Walmart and Oracle, it appears that TikTok will be able to continue its operations in the U.S.</p><p>Whether TikTok is really a national security concern remains unclear. But, one thing is clear - just like TikTok, Likee isn’t protected from scrutiny over apps with Chinese roots. Likee is owned by a company based in Singapore which in turn was purchased by China’s JOYI. Moreover, with India already ousting Likee along with other Chinese apps for being a threat to national security, the Trump administration isn’t far behind.</p><p>Listed below are a few major reasons TikTok will maintain its top spot and popularity amid all privacy concerns for the years to come.</p><h4 id="1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive-3"><a href="#1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive-3" class="headerlink" title="1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive"></a>1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive</h4><p>People on Facebook and Instagram might know that time flies by once they start scrolling through the news feed. But, TikTok is much more addictive than Facebook and Instagram. People on TikTok spend 55 minutes on the app on average. This is very interesting since it depicts the great potential for marketers.</p><p>Mostly, TikTok users spend their time in binge-watching videos. What makes TikTok so addictive is that the app enables users to express themselves through different creative ways.</p><h4 id="2-Native-Content-Editor-3"><a href="#2-Native-Content-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Native Content Editor"></a>2.Native Content Editor</h4><p>TikTok’s features to shoot footage, quickly trim and stitch together video clips and incorporate voice as well as music effects at the touch of a button makes it the ideal destination for every creator. When it comes to Likee vs. TikTok, what makes the trim feature of TikTok so enticing is that the app allows creators to storyboard their videos and publish their finished product.</p><h4 id="3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos-3"><a href="#3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos"></a>3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos</h4><p>The homepage of TikTok is much more like Twitter than Instagram or Facebook. This means that viral videos with great engagement move to the front of the line and comprise the feed. Although a “Discover” tab allows you to browse specific topics and hashtags, you are served with one video at a time.</p><p>This is a part of TikTok’s competitive advantage over Likee. With an endless number of prompts, it is easy to participate since you need not have anything interesting to talk about to get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-problem.jpg"                      alt="Tiktok Problem"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.theguardian.com/" >www.theguardian.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>No matter whether you are social media lurker or a content creator, be assured that TikTok is here to stay. Don’t believe us? Try Likee for yourself and you will soon realize that TikTok is unmatchable. In fact, with a constant surge in popularity of TikTok, it is all set to become the biggest video-sharing app ever. So with that being said, do you really think Likee can surpass TikTok?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="From-Average-to-Astounding-TikTok’s-Best-Image-Tweaks"><a href="#From-Average-to-Astounding-TikTok’s-Best-Image-Tweaks" class="headerlink" title="From Average to Astounding: TikTok’s Best Image Tweaks"></a>From Average to Astounding: TikTok’s Best Image Tweaks</h2><h1 id="Here’s-How-You-Can-Ace-the-TikTok-Photo-Editing-Hacks"><a href="#Here’s-How-You-Can-Ace-the-TikTok-Photo-Editing-Hacks" class="headerlink" title="Here’s How You Can Ace the TikTok Photo Editing Hacks"></a>Here’s How You Can Ace the TikTok Photo Editing Hacks</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-4"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-4" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>TikTok is one of the most popular social media platforms out there and it certainly needs no introduction.

Following that, you may proceed with the procedure.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Once you’ve arrived at the next screen, you’ll need to click on the <strong>Circular clock</strong> symbol to activate the effect. It is located in the bottom left corner of the screen, as seen below.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> To access it, click on it. To access the effects, tap on it once. The effects under the <strong>Filter</strong> effects section will be immediately activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-special-effects-option.jpg"                      alt="tiktok special effects option"                ></p><p>Step 2: To use this feature, you must browse the Time Effects part of the effects section. To do so, choose “<strong>Time effects</strong>“ from the drop-down menu in the bottom right corner of the screen, as shown by the arrow in the image below. It will provide you with different temporal effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-time-effects-option.jpg"                      alt="tiktok time effects option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> It is necessary to choose the <strong>Slow Motion</strong> option from the list of alternatives that appears, as shown in the figure below. This will give the video the appearance of being in slow motion.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: Changing the length of the slow-motion is accomplished by dragging the green square that appears on the screen. <strong>Drag it</strong> to any portion of the page where you want the slow-motion effect to appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-slow-motion-effect.jpg"                      alt="tiktok slow motion effect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’re pleased with the effect, you may save it by selecting the save option from the menu. As seen in the illustration below, click on “<strong>Save</strong>“ will save your work.</p><p><strong>(Note</strong>: You will be returned to the previous screen if you do so. After that, you may edit it with whatever filters you want and publish it just like any other video).</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Slow-Down-Tik-Tok-Videos-Online-for-Free-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Slow-Down-Tik-Tok-Videos-Online-for-Free-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Slow Down Tik Tok Videos Online for Free?"></a>Part 3: How to Slow Down Tik Tok Videos Online for Free?</h2><h3 id="Kapwing-3"><a href="#Kapwing-3" class="headerlink" title="Kapwing"></a>Kapwing</h3><p>In a couple of seconds, Kapwing can speed up and slow down short videos. Slo-mo, timelapse, and hyperspeed films may be made with no editing skills then shared on social networking websites like YouTube.</p><p>Get started by uploading a video or pasting a URL. AVI, MP4, MOV, and 3PG are all supported formats by Kapwing. As slow as 0.25x for a slow-motion movie and as much as 4x for an enhanced video are available. Let’s give you a step-by-step illustration:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On TikTok, find the video you want to slow down and click on. You have the option of slowing down videos from other people’s profiles and those from your profile. <strong>Copy the URL</strong> that appears when you click the <strong>Share</strong> button.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> This is where Kapwing comes in, and we utilize it on our PC using Chrome to accomplish our objective. Visit <a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/" >https://www.kapwing.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and copy the URL of the TikTok video and paste it into Kapwing.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to the Speed section, and use the – and + buttons to make the video slow down or speed up. After selecting “<strong>slow-motion</strong>“ as your preferred speed, press the “<strong>play</strong>“ button to begin watching the movie. If the video moves too slowly, click on the <strong>Plus</strong> sign and keep rewatching it until you’re satisfied with the pace.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-slow-motion-effect-kapwing-online.jpg"                      alt="add slow motion effect kapwing online"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This step is optional, but it comes in useful if you’re performing in a duet or if you want to watch a TikTok video while you’re not connected to the internet. Following your completion of the speed adjustment, go to the top of the studio and click <strong>Export</strong> <strong>Video</strong>. After your video has been processed, you may save it to your device by clicking the <strong>Download</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-or-share-looping-video-interface-kapwing.jpg"                      alt="download or share looping video interface kapwing"                ></p><p><em>For more detail, you can check this article:</em> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>How to make a slo-mo video with Kapwing</em></a><em>?</em></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Slow-TikTok-Video-And-Song-Using-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Slow-TikTok-Video-And-Song-Using-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Slow TikTok Video And Song Using Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to Slow TikTok Video And Song Using Filmora?</h2><p>In principle, TikTok can meet the majority of users’ video creation, editing, and sharing requirements.

Take a video with a trending song or audio"></a>1. Take a video with a trending song or audio</h3><p>First, you have to know what’s trending on the internet. It might not work out for you if you rarely spend time on what is happening worldwide. It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don’t have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, “The Whoa” track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.</p><h3 id="2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags"><a href="#2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="2.

Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list.

Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video.

Maintain your theme"></a>3. Maintain your theme</h3><p>Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like.

Don’t keep on mixing themes.</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video"><a href="#4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video" class="headerlink" title="4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Trending-Tasty-Treats-From-TikTok"><a href="#Trending-Tasty-Treats-From-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Trending Tasty Treats From TikTok"></a>Trending Tasty Treats From TikTok</h2><p>TikTok is one of the top video creating and sharing apps that lets you create your own short videos and share them with your followers. Most of the TikTok users are youngsters who make incredible videos while dancing, lip-syncing, cooking or singing, etc.</p><p>However, nothing can live up to the hype of the cooking TikTok videos that get viral from time to time. While Instagram is a more visual app for sharing pictures of beautifully put together plates of food, the recipes are not worth the effort.</p><p>Tiktok on the other hand delivers delicious recipes that can be made by anyone from a beginner to a professional. The food is not just visually appealing but is good enough to serve your guests.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Viral-TikTok-Food-Recipes-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Top-10-Viral-TikTok-Food-Recipes-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Viral TikTok Food Recipes You Should Know"></a>Top 10 Viral TikTok Food Recipes You Should Know</h2><p>The TikTok viral food recipes and hacks have taken the world by the storm, especially since everyone has turned a home chef since the pandemic. There is a myriad of recipes floating on the internet, but not all of them are worthy of your time.</p><p>But, the other half have not just pleasantly surprised us but have also made way to our kitchens and our staple diet. Starting off on TikTok, these recipes gained popularity and then were introduced to Instagram and Youtube. So, if you still haven’t seen any one of these recipes, you can follow the link to the recipe video and recreate recipes. So, without wasting any more time, let us see the top 10 viral TikTok recipes:</p><h3 id="1-Dalgona-Coffee"><a href="#1-Dalgona-Coffee" class="headerlink" title="1. Dalgona Coffee"></a>1. Dalgona Coffee</h3><p>Dalgona Coffee is not such a new phenomenon. It originated in the 1960s, but it was only recently that this fantastic coffee recipe got viral on TikTok. Dalgona Coffee is a mixture of water, sugar, and coffee that is whipped until the ground coffee turns caramel. The whipped coffee is then topped with iced milk, and it is ready to drink.</p><p>As 2020 began and the pandemic isolated us all in our homes, it was cooking we all turned to. Dalgona coffee is one of the top trends of that period. It all began when Korean actor Jung Il-woo shared his top-secret recipe in a program called “Stars’ Top Recipe at Fun-Staurant.” After that, many TikTokers started recreating their own version of the recipe until it became a trend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="dalgona coffee-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="2-Accordion-Potatoes"><a href="#2-Accordion-Potatoes" class="headerlink" title="2. Accordion Potatoes"></a>2. Accordion Potatoes</h3><p>Whether it’s french fries or hash browns, crispy fried potatoes have a class of their own. Perhaps that is why accordion potatoes became such a big trend on TikTok. Another reason for their popularity was that they could be excellent midnight or mid-morning snack that could be prepared in quick few steps.</p><p>Accordion potatoes can be used to elevate your potato side dish, and you can munch on them any time you want. While TikTok food influencers all made their own versions of the accordion potato, the fun part about this recipe is that you can easily alter it to your taste. Garnish it with salt, spices, garlic, or mayo; there are just too many versions to count.</p><p>The recipe is very easy, and even the dicing is not that difficult with numerous hacks available. Once diced, dip it into flour, fry it, and enjoy!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="accordion potatoes-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="3-Quesadilla-from-a-Tortilla"><a href="#3-Quesadilla-from-a-Tortilla" class="headerlink" title="3. Quesadilla from a Tortilla"></a>3. Quesadilla from a Tortilla</h3><p>If you are a big foodie just like us, then you probably have seen a tortilla turned into quesadilla videos. This recipe has been circulating all over the internet, with everyone trying their own luck and getting amazed.</p><p>The Quesadilla from a tortilla was first discovered when a TikTok user <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@crystalscookingfun?lang=en" >crystalscookingfun <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> posted a video of a round tortilla. She cut a single slit from the radius till the edge. Then she added a different ingredient in each of the quadrants and folded the tortilla in the shape of a quarter. She then placed it in a panini press, and Voila!</p><p>This recipe became a hit, and everyone began creating quesadillas with different ingredients. There were sweet ones and savory ones, including breakfast wraps, dessert wraps, and so much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="Quesadilla from a tortilla-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="4-Spicy-Vodka-Pasta-by-Gigi-Hadid"><a href="#4-Spicy-Vodka-Pasta-by-Gigi-Hadid" class="headerlink" title="4. Spicy Vodka Pasta by Gigi Hadid"></a>4. Spicy Vodka Pasta by Gigi Hadid</h3><p>The delicious and mouth-watering food Gigi Hadid cooked was something good that came out of the COVID-19 lockdown. Sharing all the recipes with her followers, all of us were no less than entertained. One of these was the highly talked about spicy vodka pasta.</p><p>While it is almost every day a new pasta dish or a pasta hack comes out, it is tough to properly cook a good pasta dish that is infused with flavors.</p><p>This quick recipe only required a few ingredients. Supermodel Gigi Hadid added some butter, parmesan cheese, shallots, heavy cream, and vodka to create this beauty. The pasta is well worth its hype. However, if you like your flavors a little differently, then you can easily create your own version of this spicy pasta sauce.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="spicy vodka pasta by gigi hadid-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="5-Pesto-Eggs"><a href="#5-Pesto-Eggs" class="headerlink" title="5. Pesto Eggs"></a>5. Pesto Eggs</h3><p>One thing is for sure; once you try pesto eggs, it will be hard for you to go back to the simple fried eggs. Pesto eggs are such a flavorful upgrade from regular eggs and an easy hack that cooks in no time. Apparently, even Hollywood actor Chris Evans is also a big fan of the pesto eggs.</p><p>To create pesto eggs, all you need to do is cook two tablespoons of pesto in a pan and then add two eggs to it. Let your eggs cook and flip them over to cook from the other side. Once cooked, you can eat your eggs as it is or serve them with toast.</p><p>You can also create your own pesto eggs by adding in some chili flakes and spices or avocados.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="pesto eggs-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="6-Two-Ingredient-Chocolate-Souffle"><a href="#6-Two-Ingredient-Chocolate-Souffle" class="headerlink" title="6. Two Ingredient Chocolate Souffle"></a>6. Two Ingredient Chocolate Souffle</h3><p>TikTok has most certainly blessed us with some delectable desserts, but none of them can match up to the Chocolate souffle. This is no simple chocolate souffle. What makes this special is that it only requires two ingredients! All you need is a few eggs and a Nutella jar, and you can make your souffle anytime, anywhere.</p><p>Just separate egg whites from the yolks and then mix the yolks in the Nutella spread. Beat the egg whites until they are fluffy, and add them to the mixture. Then bake your souffle and serve it.</p><p>This is the perfect dessert for anyone who does not regularly indulge in cooking or is unfamiliar with cooking any other french delicacies. You can serve this to your guests or enjoy it yourself with a mug of coffee.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/6-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="2 ingredient chocolate souffle-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="7-Cloud-Bread"><a href="#7-Cloud-Bread" class="headerlink" title="7. Cloud Bread"></a>7. Cloud Bread</h3><p>While you scroll through your TikTok feed, you might have found this utterly gorgeous puffs of bread called cloud bread. Cloud bread tastes just as delicious as it looks with its soft and fluffy texture.</p><p>To make cloud bread at home, all you need is three ingredients: egg whites, corn starch, and sugar. All you need to do is whip the egg whites, then add in the sugar and the cornstarch. Bake it and enjoy your cloud bread once the mixture looks like a meringue. Tear into your cloud bread and enjoy the fluffy goodness. You can layer the bread with some Nutella and jam and serve it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p><p>In truth, cloud bread is the baked version of meringue, similar to macaroons or lemon meringue pie.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="cloud bread-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="8-Corn-Ribs"><a href="#8-Corn-Ribs" class="headerlink" title="8. Corn Ribs"></a>8. Corn Ribs</h3><p>Elevate your steak dinner or barbeque part with some delicious corn ribs. You can not only serve it as a side dish, but you can also serve it as a main course. If you are looking for a meat-free meal, we highly recommend trying corn ribs.</p><p>Corn ribs are very simple to make. You take a corn ear and vertically slice it into four long ribs. Make sure you are using the corn rib after you have cleaned all the silk and dirt from it. Next, you can brush some spices mixed it oil over it to add some flavor to the corn. You can add herbs, chili flakes, or honey glaze. Now the last step is cooking the corn. You may grill it, bake it or air-fry it. You can then top it off with some cilantro or cotija cheese.</p><p>To serve your ribs, you can make a delicious dip using mayonnaise, chipotle sauce, or simply enjoy it with ketchup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="corn ribs-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="9-Hot-Cocoa-Bombs"><a href="#9-Hot-Cocoa-Bombs" class="headerlink" title="9. Hot Cocoa Bombs"></a>9. Hot Cocoa Bombs</h3><p>Another viral TikTok recipe that took the internet by a storm was the hot cocoa bombs. If you love drinking hot cocoa on chilly nights and love being a little extra, then you will love these hot cocoa bombs.</p><p>These hot cocoa bombs are pretty similar to bath bombs. As soon as you pour some hot milk or hot water over them, these chocolate bombs will melt with the yummy goodness spreading through the milk.</p><p>These chocolate spheres are filled with marshmallows, cocoa powder, sugar, sprinkles, and whatever else you like in your hot cocoa. You can customize your cocoa bombs to your taste as well. Lastly, decorate your cocoa bombs with some drizzle to give them a delicious look.</p><p>The best part about these cocoa bombs is the fact that once you make them, you can store them in a jar and use them any time you need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/9-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="hot cocoa bombs-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="10-Pancake-Cereal"><a href="#10-Pancake-Cereal" class="headerlink" title="10. Pancake Cereal"></a>10. Pancake Cereal</h3><p>While Tiktok has introduced us to many new recipes, revamping and creating something new from old recipes has its own charm. One of these wholly redone recipes is the Pancake cereal introduced by The Naughty Fork. By combining two of our breakfast favorites, they brought us something magical.</p><p>The pancake cereal consists of bite-sized pancakes that are topped with maple syrup. All you need to do is make your pancake mixture and use a teaspoon to make bite-sized pancakes. You can pour the tiny pancakes into a bowl and enjoy them with your spoon rather than slicing them and getting your face dirty.</p><p>You can also upgrade this simple recipe by adding some fruits to your bowl, whipped cream, hazelnut spread, and create your delicious pancake cereal bowl.

Here is how you do it:</p><p>1.First, you select and open the Tik Tok dance video you want to use on FilmoraX and drag it into the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/import-media-files-on-filmorax.jpg"                      alt="import media files on filmorax"                ></p><p>2.Now you will want to check that the main body of the subject is in the entire frame. If it is not, then you will need to cut and trim the video accordingly.</p><p>3.The next step is to start the motion tracking. For this, you will need to make sure that your play head is at the point from where you want to start your motion tracking. The tracking will only start wherever your play head is.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/32.motion-track.jpg"                      alt="32motion track"                ></p><p>4.Once that is done, you can open the tool used for motion tracking from the timeline toolbar. You can also do it by double-clicking your clip to find the motion tracking function in the editing menu.</p><p>5.When you have done that, the motion tracking box will appear in the preview. Move and resize it according to the subject that you wish to track. Then, select the “render-effect” option so that Filmora can analyze the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/32.box.jpg"                      alt="32box"                ></p><p>6.Now you can add the object you want to have to follow the track. You can choose that from the title menu or add a new image from your Mac.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/32.import-media.jpg"                      alt="32import media"                ></p><p>7.Once you choose your object, you simply need to drag that object to the track above your footage.</p><p>8.Next, you will need to place the object where you want it to be concerning the subject in the preview box. Make sure that you drag the edge of it on the timeline to match it with the timeline of your subject.</p><p>9.When it has been set up, you will need to double-click the footage you have added the tracking function to and go to the motion tracking menu.</p><p>10.The drop-down menu will show all the texts and images or animations available. Select the one you want to see.</p><p>11.Adjust the size of your object and voila!!

Navigation to the new video screen requires one press on the <strong>+ symbol</strong> at the bottom of your screen, as seen in the image below before it will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-record-video-button.jpg"                      alt="tiktok record video button"                ></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You will be taken to the recording area, where your phone’s camera will be launched immediately.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you first access the new video area, a bar displaying the various recording speeds displays, as seen in the screenshot below.

Can you slow them down too? The following steps illustrate how to apply a slow-motion effect to your TikTok videos once they have been recorded using the app.</p><p>It is simple to record a video by simply going to the “Add new” area and selecting the video of your choosing to record. When you’ve finished recording, choose the next choice from the drop-down menu. Following that, you may proceed with the procedure.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Once you’ve arrived at the next screen, you’ll need to click on the <strong>Circular clock</strong> symbol to activate the effect. It is located in the bottom left corner of the screen, as seen below.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> To access it, click on it. To access the effects, tap on it once.

To do so, choose “<strong>Time effects</strong>“ from the drop-down menu in the bottom right corner of the screen, as shown by the arrow in the image below. It will provide you with different temporal effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-time-effects-option.jpg"                      alt="tiktok time effects option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> It is necessary to choose the <strong>Slow Motion</strong> option from the list of alternatives that appears, as shown in the figure below. This will give the video the appearance of being in slow motion.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: Changing the length of the slow-motion is accomplished by dragging the green square that appears on the screen. <strong>Drag it</strong> to any portion of the page where you want the slow-motion effect to appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-slow-motion-effect.jpg"                      alt="tiktok slow motion effect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’re pleased with the effect, you may save it by selecting the save option from the menu.

Slo-mo, timelapse, and hyperspeed films may be made with no editing skills then shared on social networking websites like YouTube.</p><p>Get started by uploading a video or pasting a URL. AVI, MP4, MOV, and 3PG are all supported formats by Kapwing. As slow as 0.25x for a slow-motion movie and as much as 4x for an enhanced video are available. Let’s give you a step-by-step illustration:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On TikTok, find the video you want to slow down and click on. You have the option of slowing down videos from other people’s profiles and those from your profile. <strong>Copy the URL</strong> that appears when you click the <strong>Share</strong> button.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> This is where Kapwing comes in, and we utilize it on our PC using Chrome to accomplish our objective. Visit <a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/" >https://www.kapwing.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and copy the URL of the TikTok video and paste it into Kapwing.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to the Speed section, and use the – and + buttons to make the video slow down or speed up. After selecting “<strong>slow-motion</strong>“ as your preferred speed, press the “<strong>play</strong>“ button to begin watching the movie. If the video moves too slowly, click on the <strong>Plus</strong> sign and keep rewatching it until you’re satisfied with the pace.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-slow-motion-effect-kapwing-online.jpg"                      alt="add slow motion effect kapwing online"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This step is optional, but it comes in useful if you’re performing in a duet or if you want to watch a TikTok video while you’re not connected to the internet. Following your completion of the speed adjustment, go to the top of the studio and click <strong>Export</strong> <strong>Video</strong>. After your video has been processed, you may save it to your device by clicking the <strong>Download</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-or-share-looping-video-interface-kapwing.jpg"                      alt="download or share looping video interface kapwing"                ></p><p><em>For more detail, you can check this article:</em> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>How to make a slo-mo video with Kapwing</em></a><em>?</em></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Slow-TikTok-Video-And-Song-Using-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Slow-TikTok-Video-And-Song-Using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Slow TikTok Video And Song Using Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to Slow TikTok Video And Song Using Filmora?</h2><p>In principle, TikTok can meet the majority of users’ video creation, editing, and sharing requirements.

Navigation to the new video screen requires one press on the <strong>+ symbol</strong> at the bottom of your screen, as seen in the image below before it will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-record-video-button.jpg"                      alt="tiktok record video button"                ></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You will be taken to the recording area, where your phone’s camera will be launched immediately.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you first access the new video area, a bar displaying the various recording speeds displays, as seen in the screenshot below. It is necessary to pick the slowest feasible speed.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> You may also select the video’s pace based on your preferences and how sluggish you want to make the movie seem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-video-recording-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="tiktok video recording speed option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next to selecting the desired speed, you must go to the following screen. It is possible to see a <strong>Check Mark</strong> option appear in the right-hand corner of the screen, as seen in the illustration. Tap on it once to advance to the next stage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/confirm-tiktok-recording-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="confirm tiktok recording speed option"                ></p><p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>4:</strong> Then, go to the next step after selecting the desired speed. As seen below, you must record the video by <strong>Tapping and Holding the Red Color Record button</strong> for some time.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Once the video has been recorded and is in a slower speed, it will automatically be recorded in slow motion. You can use this method to record your TikTok videos with a slow-motion effect.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-o-Add-Slow-Mo-Effects-After-Recording-Videos-on-Tik-Tok-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-o-Add-Slow-Mo-Effects-After-Recording-Videos-on-Tik-Tok-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How o Add Slow-Mo Effects After Recording Videos on Tik Tok?"></a>Part 2: How o Add Slow-Mo Effects After Recording Videos on Tik Tok?</h2><p>What about the videos you have already recorded on your TikTok application? Can you slow them down too? The following steps illustrate how to apply a slow-motion effect to your TikTok videos once they have been recorded using the app.</p><p>It is simple to record a video by simply going to the “Add new” area and selecting the video of your choosing to record. When you’ve finished recording, choose the next choice from the drop-down menu. Following that, you may proceed with the procedure.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Once you’ve arrived at the next screen, you’ll need to click on the <strong>Circular clock</strong> symbol to activate the effect. It is located in the bottom left corner of the screen, as seen below.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> To access it, click on it. To access the effects, tap on it once. The effects under the <strong>Filter</strong> effects section will be immediately activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-special-effects-option.jpg"                      alt="tiktok special effects option"                ></p><p>Step 2: To use this feature, you must browse the Time Effects part of the effects section. To do so, choose “<strong>Time effects</strong>“ from the drop-down menu in the bottom right corner of the screen, as shown by the arrow in the image below. It will provide you with different temporal effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-time-effects-option.jpg"                      alt="tiktok time effects option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> It is necessary to choose the <strong>Slow Motion</strong> option from the list of alternatives that appears, as shown in the figure below. This will give the video the appearance of being in slow motion.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: Changing the length of the slow-motion is accomplished by dragging the green square that appears on the screen. <strong>Drag it</strong> to any portion of the page where you want the slow-motion effect to appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-slow-motion-effect.jpg"                      alt="tiktok slow motion effect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’re pleased with the effect, you may save it by selecting the save option from the menu.

You might have imagined that you would also be famous and feature on some popular platform if you possessed these abilities.</p><p>We are going to talk about these audio effects on TikTok videos today. We’ll show you <strong>How to Change Voice on TikTok</strong> and apply voice modifications there, as well as on a popular and widely used third-party software.

You can’t utilize Voice Effects in films created with built-in themes, including audio, for example.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin recording your clip, launch TikTok and hit the <strong>+ (plus symbol)</strong> at the base.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press the <strong>Record</strong> button, record your video as usual, and tap it again to stop or end the recording.

TikTok offers you the chance to further customize the video by making modifications to the added text. Here are three ways in which you can further customize your TikTok video:</p><p><strong>1. How to Put Text on TikTok and Make It Disappear?</strong></p><p>TikTok allows you to control when your text that appears onscreen. The single condition is that it must be visible for at least one full second. All you have to do now is follow these steps to determine the length of your content.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Tap on the <strong>Text</strong> you want to edit.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You’ll need to pick <strong>Set duration</strong> to change the time of the text on your video. This will take you to a panel where you can control when the text displays and, if necessary, when it fades away. <strong><em>Drag the timing bar</em></strong> so that it fits perfectly to choose a start and finish time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-text-duraiton-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="set text duraiton tiktok video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong><em>Drag the red box</em></strong> around the bottom of the timeline to choose when the text should appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-text-duration-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="adjust text duration tiktok video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap the <strong>Checkmark</strong> in the bottom right-hand corner once you’re done.</p><p><strong>2. How to Change TikTok Text, Font, and Size?</strong></p><p>Customization of your textual videos on TikTok isn’t restricted to adding and disappearing the text or adding multiple lines of text. You also change the text font and size of your captions by using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> By tapping the <strong>A</strong> on the left side of the display, you can <strong><em>Highlight</em></strong> the text.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can alter the <strong>Fonts</strong> by picking an alternative from the <strong><em>multi-colored circles</em></strong> at the bottom of the display.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-texts-font-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="change texts font tiktok video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> TikTok further allows you to alter the color by choosing an alternative from the <strong>Color options</strong> provided on the top-left side of the text menu.</p><p><strong>3. How to Add Multiple Lines of Text to Your TikTok?</strong></p><p>One line of text isn’t always sufficient. You can add your first in-video caption by completing the procedures outlined above. Then follow these steps to learn how to use the TikTok editor to add various texts to your clips.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Tap the <strong>Text</strong> button once again once you’ve added your first line of text to your video.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Type</strong> the new caption line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-multiple-texts-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="add multiple texts tiktok video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose a <strong>Font</strong> and a <strong>Color</strong>.

This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.</p><p>At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.</p><p>In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.</p><p>• Working with the Text</p><p>For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.</p><p>• Adding Effects</p><p>Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.</p><p>Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. <strong>The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos</strong> so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone. Last, but not least, <strong>the dimension has to be 1080 x 1920.</strong></p><h2 id="Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac-2"><a href="#Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac-2" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.

This effect imitates the flash of a diamond being struck by the sun in different locations across the film.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-bling-filter.jpg"                      alt="tiktok bling effect"                ></p><h3 id="5-TikTok’s-Disney-Effect"><a href="#5-TikTok’s-Disney-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5.TikTok’s Disney Effect"></a>5.TikTok’s Disney Effect</h3><p>The Disney TikTok filter gives you a chance to experience what it’s like to be a Disney princess or prince. This effect transforms your face into a Disney-inspired cartoon character.</p><p>This filter, like the anime filter, is available on Snapchat. So make sure you’ve downloaded that app first.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-disney-filter.jpg"                      alt="tiktok disney effect"                ></p><h3 id="6-TikTok-Dog-Face"><a href="#6-TikTok-Dog-Face" class="headerlink" title="6.TikTok Dog Face"></a>6.TikTok Dog Face</h3><p>The Dog Face filter is another amusing face to experiment on. You get dog ears, a nose, and even a tongue with this one. However, you must record another filter in Snapchat before publishing it to TikTok.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-dog-face.jpg"                      alt="tiktok dog face"                ></p><h3 id="7-TikTok’s-Inverted-Filter"><a href="#7-TikTok’s-Inverted-Filter" class="headerlink" title="7.TikTok’s Inverted Filter"></a>7.TikTok’s Inverted Filter</h3><p>The Inverted filter is a little more divisive than the others. This filter flips any video you capture, and it’s famous for using the front-facing camera because it’s said to mimic how other people perceive you. So, what’s the big deal about it? On the other hand, the inverted filter has enraged some users, who don’t always appreciate their “true” reflection. However, the only way to see what all the fuss (or hysteria) is about is to give it a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-inverted-filter.jpg"                      alt="tiktok inverted filter"                ></p><h3 id="8-TikTok’s-Face-Zoom-effect"><a href="#8-TikTok’s-Face-Zoom-effect" class="headerlink" title="8.TikTok’s Face Zoom effect"></a>8.TikTok’s Face Zoom effect</h3><p>As the name suggests, the Face Zoom effect zooms-in on your face. Some people use it in group videos to see which face the filter lands on, while others use the same to compare how you look up close versus how you look from a distance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-face-zoom-effect.jpg"                      alt="tiktok face zoom effect"                ></p><h3 id="9-TikTok’s-Face-Morph"><a href="#9-TikTok’s-Face-Morph" class="headerlink" title="9.TikTok’s Face Morph"></a>9.TikTok’s Face Morph</h3><p>The Face Morph effect is another popular effect. This one lets you morph and transition between multiple images of someone else’s face. The effect may be under TikTok’s Templates area because it employs graphics rather than video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-face-morph.jpg"                      alt="tiktok face morph"                ></p><h3 id="10-TikTok’s-Beauty-Filter"><a href="#10-TikTok’s-Beauty-Filter" class="headerlink" title="10.TikTok’s Beauty Filter"></a>10.TikTok’s Beauty Filter</h3><p>For obvious reasons, the Beauty filter is popular on TikTok. It improves your appearance by evening out skin tone, adding color, and improving overall appearance. It’s commonly useful in conjunction with other filters and effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-beauty-filter.jpeg"                      alt="tiktok beauty filter"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Use-of-Filters-for-TikTok-by-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Use-of-Filters-for-TikTok-by-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make Use of Filters for TikTok by Filmora?"></a>Part 2: How to Make Use of Filters for TikTok by Filmora?</h2><p>Wondershare’s Filmora video editor features the standard overlays, transitions, editing, and effects that we’ve come to expect from enthusiast-level video editors.
