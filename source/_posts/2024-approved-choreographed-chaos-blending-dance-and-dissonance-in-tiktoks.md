So, if you have tagged your content with a specific hashtag, your post is likely to appear in the content list for someone searching for a relevant hashtag. However, the PFP hashtag is used for different purposes on TikTok. It helps you get maximum likes. Plus, it may also increase your followership by engaging your audience in funny profile pictures. So, the PFP hashtag must be checked to find crazy profile pictures and videos.
