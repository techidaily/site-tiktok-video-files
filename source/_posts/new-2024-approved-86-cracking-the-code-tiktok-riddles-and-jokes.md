TikTok app only allows you to stitch a video for up to five seconds which is quite frustrating if you wish to stitch an entire video.

One more reason is that, with TikTok, you cannot stitch the already existing video from the camera roll, which restricts creators from adding the already edited content to the existing video. So, to avoid the above problems, Filmora is used for stitching TikTok videos.

**Step 1:** Launch the Filmora software on your PC and import the video files by clicking on the **File** and then **Import/Export Media**. You can simply drag and drop the videos as well.

**Step 2:** Drag the clips from the media library to the Timeline's video track. All video files will be stitched into a single video with no transitions.

## Part 5: FAQs About TikTok Video Stitch

**1\. Can you do a Stitch on TikTok with a video from your Camera Roll?**

Unfortunately, you cannot utilize a video from your Camera Roll in a Stitch at the time of this writing. So, whatever your reaction to a Stitch is, you must record 100% unique footage shot with the TikTok camera. However, you may download the video first and then stitch it with some third-party software such as Filmora.

**2\. Can you stitch longer than 5 seconds?**

No, it is not possible to stitch a video for longer than five seconds using the built-in Stitching feature of the TikTok app. But this can be done by stitching the videos using third-party applications and software.

**3\. How do I see TikTok stitches?**

Users who want to view as many stitches as possible can do it by browsing for them on the app. You must first browse to **Discover,** and from there to the search box. Then type **#Stitch @username,** where the **username** is the name of the account from which you wish to view stitches.

**4\. TikTok Stitch option not showing. How to fix it?**

Users may choose whether or not someone else can Stitch their work in their settings. The option may be found under the **Settings** and **Privacy** tab, where users can activate or uncheck Stitch for all videos. So, if the Stitch option is not showing, the user may have disabled the Stitch option.

**Conclusion**

The Stitch feature is an excellent way to continue the discussion with your videos. You may leave comments on popular content on the site. Most importantly, it may be a fun method to generate material different from what you usually publish. And since you know **How to Stitch on TikTok** after reading this article, stitch the videos today and create unique content!
