### 3. Don't exceed the character limit

The character limit of the TikTok username is around 24 characters. It is one of the valuable factors you shouldn't violate while picking your name. You can save your characters and use them intelligently to showcase your audience or identity thoroughly. Extract the most crucial aspects of your brand and display those in your username.

## Part 3: Top 3 TikTok Username Generators

The TikTok username generator is generally for designing fonts. Since TikTok does not allow this facility, it helps users work on unforgettable characters in their nicknames. Using an incredible TikTok username generator can also help you creatively attract more followers.

Here's all you are required to know regarding grabbing the good TikTok usernames!

### 1. Cool Generator

As the name suggests, it's a pretty cool username generator that you can use by just putting the random idea. However, you also can select among a **boy** or a **girl** from the drop-down menu. Beneath these tabs, you have **an Idea** to describe your thoughts or brand identity in a few simple words or phrases.

For instance, we have entered **the Dance** keyword, and it offers a ton of ideas, including new ones.

## Part 1: Tips for Choosing a Good TikTok Usernames

What do they all have in common? Genuineness and originality! When you first create a TikTok account, you get a username auto-assigned. After that, you can easily edit your profile and change it to something intriguing. Know that whatever you set cannot be modified for almost 30 days. So when picking a name, here are a few tips:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1. Describe your identity

Describe to your followers what you do. They might gather some idea of what your profile is all about based upon your videos, but you don't want to rely entirely on them.

What if you choose to make a video essential to you but has nothing to do with your identity?

It can be only a few phrases or words, so ensure that you tell them precisely what you wish people to know before they decide whether or not they will follow you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2. Always go for a memorable name

Pick a name that your viewers can never forget. Of course, it should be an exciting identity everyone wants to pronounce. For this purpose, you can analyze the names of your competitors, your favorite TikTokers or go through some kids' channels over there. They're pretty cute to consider as well and may help you gather tons of ideas that you've never thought of.

### 3. Don't exceed the character limit

The character limit of the TikTok username is around 24 characters. It is one of the valuable factors you shouldn't violate while picking your name. You can save your characters and use them intelligently to showcase your audience or identity thoroughly. Extract the most crucial aspects of your brand and display those in your username.
