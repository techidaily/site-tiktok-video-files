## Part 1: What is Voice Effect?

Picture filters are widely used on Instagram and Snapchat, and we are all acquainted with them. Such filters enable us to add a subtle color change or any other type of modification to our filters. However, because TikTok is all about audio and video, you may utilize voice filters in your videos.

Speech filters are sound effects that enable us to alter our voices. It's worth noting that users can only use the application to apply speech filters to their recorded voice. When you're not using or uploading any recordings, you won't utilize any voice effects.

Built-in voice effects in TikTok include chipmunk, baritone, mike, megaphone, robot, battery drain, shaking, electronic, echo, synth, elf, huge, and acoustic signals.

## Part 2: How to Record and Add Voice TikTok?

Your video must feature your voice to apply Voice Effects. You can't utilize Voice Effects in films created with built-in themes, including audio, for example.

**Step 1:** To begin recording your clip, launch TikTok and hit the **\+ (plus symbol)** at the base.

**Step 2:** Press the **Record** button, record your video as usual, and tap it again to stop or end the recording. Once you're done recording, tick the **Checkmark.**

**Step 3:** Select **Voice Effects** from the drop-down menu on the upper right.

![record tiktok video with audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-tiktok-video-audio.jpg)

**Step 4:** Tap to hear every one of the effects as the window opens up from the bottom. When you wish to utilize one, pick it and move your finger away from the screen. Tap **None** on the far left when you don't want to employ an voice effect.

**Step 5:** After that, you may add any extra effects to your movie, such as text stickers. When you're finished, tap **Next**. Proceed to choose your Post choices, save the video, or touch **Post** as you would with any other video you've made.

The editing capabilities in TikTok are adequate yet rudimentary. You may upload and modify existing movies and photographs or record yourself for up to three minutes. Turn to CapCut's ShortCut option if you want a simpler TikTok or Dubsmash-style editing experience.

CapCut will question you about the movies and photographs in your photo library that you'd want to import into the composition when you're in this mode. After that, the program analyzes your video and recommends a variety of designs, which each alters the music, timing, and changes.

For instance, you may add a pop rhythm, disco groove, or urban funk flavor to your film. CapCut allows you to select from a licensed library of songs or import sounds you've recorded.

Here's how to change the voice on TikTok using Capcut:

**Step 1:** Open the **Capcut application** on your phone and I**mport** a video/audio file or record a short sample.

**Step 3:** After recording, now press on the **Checkmark** to save the sample.

**Step 4:** Now tap on the recorded area on the **Timeline** to enable the **Voice Effects**.

**Step 5:** Select the **Voice Effects** according to your liking from the given options and press on the **Checkmark** to save the video.
