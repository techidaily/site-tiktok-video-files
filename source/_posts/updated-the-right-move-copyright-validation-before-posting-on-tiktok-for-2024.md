## The Right Move: Copyright Validation Before Posting on TikTok

So, you have successfully created an awesome TikTok video with the perfect dance moves and accurate lip-sync. But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!

The reason?

Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!

This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.

So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?

To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.

And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.

## **Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?**

To avoid getting banned!

You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.

The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.

If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.

To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.

But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?

Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.

## **Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading**

Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it. But this option is only available on desktop browsers.

Therefore, if you’re posting a sound other than one from TikTok’s library, you can check if it’s copyrighted or not from your PC.

Here’s how:

**Step 1**

Go to the website version of [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/) from Chrome, and click on “Log In” at the top-right corner of the page. You can also click on “Log In” under the “Following” option on the left.

According to TikTok’s policies, if a video has copyrighted sound, it will be muted, and if the video itself is copyrighted, like a clip from a movie or song, it will be taken down.

However, if you continue posting copyrighted content even after receiving copyright infringement notices from TikTok, it can result in your getting shut down for good!

Therefore, it’s good to know how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading through the steps explained in the article.

 _“Despite the odds, Tik Tok remains in place and stays favorite for most social media users.”_

Especially in Tier 3 and Tier 4 markets, TikTok forms a strong user base. For the same reason, brands are trying to make their products famous via customer reach in these markets.

You know, the main goal of marketing is to convert visitors into customers. And, you have plenty of platforms to show your marketing skills to reach the target audience. One of the highly influential and growing platforms is TikTok. At the same time, **TikTok influencer** marketing plays an essential role in day-to-day life because billions of people use the app every minute. Just like YouTube, you have to sell your products or brand to indulge in marketing with TikTok influencers. The campaign generally revolves around creating, sharing, and sometimes video lives streaming to let people know about your brand and sell related products.

![TikTok Influencer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-influencer.jpg)

Recently, Amir Siddiqui, a Tik Tok star, claimed that Tik Tok's short video format is more in use by brands as compared to other platforms like YouTube, Facebook, etc. Brands have significantly made the Chinese app in their list of favorites. Also, in the new COVID-19 global pandemic situation, many high-end influencers are resorting to TikTok as the most cost-effective marketing method.

So, let’s figure out what algorithm works behind influencer marketing TikTok. After analyzing the strategies of expert tik tokers and looking at their interviews, we have devised an ultimate guide on how to become an influencer on TikTok.

## How to be a good TikTok influencer and Stand Out from Peers

No doubt, influencer marketing at TikTok works. But is it easy? Well, not at all due to the increasing competition. Look at the content, and the way users who have millions or billions of followers on TikTok create videos. They put complete effort into making a video. It doesn't come as it is. You have to consider various creative elements to get that video on the platform to convert visitors into customers. Even though Tik tok follows the YouTube creator revenue-sharing model, the brands are more likely to approach TikTok creators than Youtubers. Brand marketers check Tik Tok Creator's Marketplace in terms of followers count, audience demographics, and the form of content.

Given below are three elements you have to consider in TikTok influencer marketing. It will ultimately tell you how to use TikTok for marketing.

* [Part 1: Prepare yourself before shooting TikTok videos](#part1)
* [Part 2: Properly manage TikTok account](#part2)
* [Part 3: Deal with the Feedbacks and Comments from your Fans and Haters](#part3)

### Part 1: Prepare yourself before shooting TikTok videos

First, prepare yourself and then take steps forward if you are looking to make a video that stands out better, among others. You can even access lots of features on the app.

The very first step is to consider your interest. That interest will lead you to make content that stands out from others. However, it is not the only thing you have to keep in mind. There are related factors such as demand, competition, and overall marketing analysis.

Do not forget to keep up with the trend. Whether you are making a highly entertaining or educational informative video, you have to make extra effort to get that real-time engagement. After analyzing your target audience, look up to your position among other Tik Tok creators. If you are a complete beginner, then it may take 2-3 months to get that level only if you are consistent and following all the algorithms applicable in-app.

#### Target Audience

Target audiences are your ultimate customers. Most of the target audience base in Tik Tok comprises of youngsters. So, you have to make a user-friendly content to attract sponsorships and targeted brands. You can target a particular audience by incorporating their interests into the video, such as hashtags, their favorite music, and performing duets.

#### Analyze Tik Tok marketing

Well, most of the marketing analysis portion has to be done by the brands. They have to look for a suitable creator with a good number of followers to advertise their products. And, all of this is possible only when you have a receptive Tik Tok account. So, it's essential to pay attention to various promotion strategies to get those followers, likes, and real-time engagements.

#### Position Basic Tools

To make an attractive video, you will need a laptop or PC, your favorite background music available on TikTok itself, or you can even download music from TikTok. Then, you need a video of your own which you want to sync with the music. And, after having all of these things, consider a versatile video editing tool.

For this purpose, we are going to use [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This multi-dimensional tool comes with both primary as well as advanced video editing features. It is a '_Video Editor for all Creators.'_ With support in various formats, it also consists of different motion elements, transitions, and royalty-free music. After you complete making an eye-catchy video, you can directly export them to various social media platforms.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Let’s look at some quick tips.

* Show off skills
* Try imitating other famous videos
* Be updated with the trend
* Always be with your ready camera as you might bump into some exciting moment.
* Participate in hashtag challenges and other TikTok events.
* Try to cover current events to reach a broad audience.

Well, this is not the last step in the TikTok influencer marketing strategy. Also, give a read to the other two dimensions given below.

### Part 2: Properly manage TikTok account

Have you heard of social media managers? They play a vital role in the lives of influencers. After reaching a particular stage, any famous social media influencer has to appoint their account managers to keep up on daily activities. Keeping the mind the strong youth orientation on TikTok, you have to keep an eye on your regular account activity.

At this stage, you have to consider video promotions. Look up to your category and try collaborating with other famous TikTok creators. It is essential for actual audience engagement.

#### Promote TikTok videos

Share as much as possible. In this way, your video will appear on For You Page if people like your content. Being on For You Pages is also one of the efficient methods for video promotion. But, then again, it comes out to be on producing a likable content. Brand yourself in a particular niche or interest, as we have mentioned already.

#### Engage the audience

Engagement means when people are spending most of their time on your TikTok videos. So, it depends upon what you have made. Do not put any kind of boring content as it can lead to bounce rates just like Google. The practical method of audience engagement is looking from their perspective. Think about your followers and their likings.

#### Increase followers and likes

Here are some tips to increase your likes and followers on TikTok.

* Avoid copied content and post only original content.
* Be consistent in posting videos.
* Integrate popular TikTok songs or music.
* Perform duets.
* Follow your expert creators.
* Get your way on trends and hashtags.
* Use quality equipment and software for editing purposes.
* Follow others to gain followers.
* Improve photography or shooting skills.
* Share it on other social media platforms.

### Part 3: Deal with the Feedbacks and Comments from your Fans and Haters

Dealing with your fans and haters is also vital to keep along with creating TikTok videos. Give replies, if possible, and always pay due respect to your fans. It doesn't mean that you have to indulge in intense fights with haters. Trolls are everywhere, so it's better to ignore them until the situation is life-threatening.

### Conclusion

When you are a **TikTok influencer** or even any other social media marketer, each of your action impacts millions of people. So, try to be original and create eye-catchy videos to rank better, among others. Follow all the tips mentioned above, including the versatile video editing software.
