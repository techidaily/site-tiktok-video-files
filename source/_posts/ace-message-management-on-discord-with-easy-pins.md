Like TeamSpeak or Skype, Discord is a chat app aimed at easy mass communication. Although it was made for gamers, it is readily used for communicating in offices, during projects, or for professional collaboration.

Even though it's straightforward to use, there are several Discord features that you may be unfamiliar with.

One such feature is called pinning messages. It is available to moderators, administrators, server owners, and other users who have permission to "Manage Messages" in various server channels.

This feature helps you find and share vital messages quickly, especially when new users join a specific channel.

It acts like a sticky note for Discord, making sure valuable information such as server rules do not get overshadowed by new messages even months after the pinned messages are first posted.

Today, we will go over how to pin a message on Discord for your desktop app on PC and Mac, as well as on your iPhone and Android mobile devices.

## Part 1: How to Pin A Message on Discord Desktop?

If you want to learn how to pin messages on Discord desktop, follow these steps:

1. Hover over any message which you wish to pin.
2. On the right-hand side of it, there will be a button that would read as More; click it and you will see a screen like below

![ Pin message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-messages-on-discord.jpg)

1. Now, click on the "Pin Message" option
2. After which, you will be presented with a prompt asking you to confirm that you want to pin this particular message. Click on "Oh yeah, pin it."

![ Pin message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/double-check-pin-messages.jpg)

That's it! You have now learned how to pin messages on Discord for the desktop application.

But make sure you don't pin everything that might seem important at a glance — only pin messages that may have utility in the future.

Also, don't pin messages that are just important for you. In larger channels, prioritize pinning messages that will benefit most participants.

## Part 2: How to Pin Messages on Discord Mobile App?

Pinning messages in the mobile app is very similar to how it is done on the desktop application. Do it by:

1. Just hold down your finger on the message you wish to pin
2. A couple of seconds later, you will be presented with a list of options
3. From here, click on "Pin Message"

![ Pin message on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-message-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. A pop-up will appear confirming if you want to pin the message. If you are sure you want to pin a particular message, tap the "Yes" button and then your message is pinned

## Part 3: How to View Pinned Messages on Discord

Accessing pinned messages is just as easy as pinning them. To access a pinned message on the app's desktop version:

1. Click on the pin icon appearing on the top right-hand side of your screen

![view Pinned message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-pinned-message.jpg)

1. Doing this will present you with a drop-down list of pinned messages. Now, you can tap on the "Jump" button next to the "x" (cross) icon to go directly to the pinned message
2. This will allow you to understand the context behind the pinned message. You can also access and share links in the pinned messages from here

## Part 4: How to View Pinned Messages on Discord Mobile

View your pins on the mobile version of Discord by:

1. Swiping from right to left, which will open up a side menu
2. Then click on "Pins," which is the second option from the left, as shown in the picture below

![view Pinned message on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-pinned-message-discord-mobile.jpg)

1. Now you will be in the pinned messages window
2. You can jump to a specific pinned message by clicking on it, allowing you to access any content or links in the message

## Part 5: Limit on Pinned Messages

You can only pin 50 messages in the pin box in Discord, meaning if you want to pin new messages, you will have to delete older ones to make space.

This may feel like a disadvantage. However, it makes perfect sense. Pinning messages is only for important information that must be used in the future.

Removing this limit and giving people free rein on the number of messages they can pin will eventually lead to too many pinned messages, defeating the feature's purpose.

## Part 6: How to Delete Pinned Messages on Discord?

If something pinned in the past has become redundant over time, you can remove it from the pinned messages.

This will make sure your pinned messages do not stockpile over time, and there is space to add new messages important to the server.

To remove pinned messages on desktops:

1. Go to the pin icon used to access pins
2. Next, hover over the message you wish to unpin and click on the "x" (cross) button next to the jump button
3. After this, click on the "yeah, remove it please kthx" button
4. The message will now stop appearing in the list of pinned messages

To do the same for mobile devices:

1. Swipe right to left to access the side menu
2. Click on "Pins" to view all the messages pinned by you or other people on the server with permissions to pin
3. Then hold down on the message, which will give you an option to unpin it
4. Click on "Unpin" to remove the message from the list of pinned messages

**Things to keep in mind**:

* You can skip the pop-up shown above when trying to remove a pinned message. All you must do is hold shift when clicking on the "x" (cross) button allowing you to go on that spree of unpins
* Another thing to remember is that all these tips on how pin messages apply to both Direct Messages (DM) and Server group chats

#### All in All

Learning how to pin a message on Discord could be a little tricky at first, mostly if you haven't done so in the past and someone spontaneously asks you to do so.

However, the feature is pretty intuitive and straightforward once you get the hang of it.

The usefulness of pinning makes it very important for both old and new users as you can relay important information without having to go through tons of old messages.

# How to Connect Spotify to Discord

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Discord is a popular chat app explicitly designed for socializing. You can use it to remain connected, share screen space, and even listen to music along with friends and other users.

While Discord allows you to add a music bot to any server with relative ease, you can also add your Spotify account to it and show friends what you’re listening to via your Discord status.

With this exciting feature, all your friends can discover the music you play, listen along to it, and even see what you’re up to.

So, if you’re wondering how to connect Spotify to Discord, here’s your answer.

* [Part 1: Connect Spotify To Discord on Windows PC/Mac Directly](#part1)
* [Part 2: Connect Spotify To Discord With Bot](#part2)
* [Part 3: Connect Spotify To Discord Mobile App](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Link Spotify To Discord on Windows PC/Mac Directly

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Linking Spotify to Discord on windows PC/Mac is relatively easy. Just follow the steps below:

1. Turn your computer on and launch your discord app, or you can sign into the web-browser version instead
2. Click on the User Settings option in your discord app — one with a small gear icon placed at the lower right corner of the screen, alongside your username
3. Within the User Settings, you’ll see a Connections section atop the left-sidebar; click it. All accounts that are connected to the discord account are visible here
4. Now, click the Spotify icon below the Connect Your Accounts option. A new window will appear in the browser; you can sign in to the Spotify account using your username and password or your Facebook account. Once you log in, connect Spotify to Discord

![Supported Connection on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-connections.jpg)

As you allow your Spotify account to connect to Discord, the connections tab will show Spotify and Discord are connected.

It will also display a badge on your Discord profile, which shows your Spotify username (if you like, you can also turn this off via the connections menu).

![Connect  Spotify to  Discord and set as status](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-spotify-as-status-on-discord.jpg)

By default, whenever you’ll play some music on Spotify using the same PC/Mac you are signed in to your Discord account, the status will suddenly change into “listening to Spotify.”

Users can see what tracks you are playing by simply clicking your name. Not just that, but they can also play the same tracks on their Mac or PC and even “listen along.”

This facility will let your friends tune into and listen to the same thing you’re listening to! If you want to, you can turn off this setting via the Connections menu.

Lastly, you can also click this plus (+) sign near to chat box and choose the option ‘Invite to listen to Spotify.’ This will send users links, allowing them to join you via the “listen along” feature.

## Part 2: How to Connect Spotify To Discord With Bot

The bot is a mini-program, which requires to be installed on your main program. So, in this scenario, let’s take the “Groovy” bot and install it on your Discord server to connect Spotify to Discord.

Once installed, it will add additional Spotify functions to the Discord server, allowing members to activate particular functions through typing text commands.

![Add Groovy bot to Discord Server](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-groovy-music-bot-to-music.jpg)

**Note:** There are several Spotify bots out there for Discord; however, Groovy is one of [the best discord music bots](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) available.

Here’s how you can connect Spotify to Discord with a bot:
