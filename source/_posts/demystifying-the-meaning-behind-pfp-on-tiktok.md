## Part 4: How to Download A TikTok Video to Fast Forward on iPhone and Android?

TikTok users were not allowed to fast forward or rewind videos inside the app for the longest time. TikTok recently added this feature; however, this new feature is not accessible for all users.

So, for those of you without this feature, we have found a way around it to let you fast forward and rewind your favorite TikTok videos; download them and that too without watermark on your iPhone or Android. Here's how.

**Step 1:** Open the TikTok app, and select the video that you wish to download for fast-forwarding or rewinding.

**Step 2:** Share this video page by clicking on the arrow icon located at the bottom-right of the page. If the publisher has enabled the download feature, you'll be able to save the video to your gallery.

## Part 5: How to Fast Forward Videos in TikTok on a PC?

Following its meteoric increase in popularity, most users expressed a desire to utilize it on their PC to connect with friends and explore new musical and video compositions by like-minded individuals. This is why TikTok made significant improvements in its PC version. The majority of the features formerly restricted to mobile applications can now be accessed using a web browser.

Even though certain features are still restricted for PC TikTok, there is little need to utilize additional features to get the most out of your TikTok use. In addition, you can simply fast forward and rewind video recordings on a computer with relative ease. To learn more, just follow these easy steps:

**Step 1:** Log in to your TikTok account by going to the TikTok website on your PC.

**Step 2:** Once you're on the home page, click on any video that you may wish to view.

**Step 3:** Once the video opens, you will see a progress meter at the bottom of the video. The bar continues to thicken throughout the video. A white dot will emerge if you hold your cursor above the bar. Now, you can conveniently fast forward and rewind any video just by moving the white dot forward or backward.
