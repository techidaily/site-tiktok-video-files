That is where TikTok video templates come in. They are ready-to-use assets you can edit and personalize to make original videos quickly. By using templates, you can stand toe-to-toe with other content creators on the platform.

![pexels tiktok video template selection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-video-templates-pexels.JPG)

| **Number of Templates** | 91+             |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| **Price**               | Pexels is free. |

Pexels is a website that provides you with lots of free videos and photos. You can also find video templates on the website. The best thing is that Pexels does not require attribution - though it encourages giving them. Furthermore, Pexels allow you to edit the media you get from the site. You would not get into legal trouble unless you did something they do not allow, like making identifiable people appear in a bad light.

The catch is that Pexels is only a website where you can find and download stock resources. It does not provide you with any editing tools. Therefore, it's only a good choice if you already have a trusty editor. Or use it in combination with the other options here.

### 5\. Use Envato Elements
