## Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Mac OS

TikTok users like you flock to the app due to its entertainment value, global reach, and ease of use. When we talk about ease of use, we refer to the option of directly uploading a video on your TikTok profile from Mac.

The best thing about TikTok on Mac is that it has made it fairly easy for anyone to use their platform. If you want to upload a video to TikTok on Mac OS you will find it a child’s play. TikTok has a website version of the platform for people to use if they are on their computer.

1. You should choose a video that has already been editing by video editing software as the website will not allow you to make any edits. We always emphasize using only the best video editor for Mac.

2. Go to Safari and search for the website of TikTok.

3. Once you are on there, you will need to Log in to your account by clicking on the button that appears on the top right corner of the window.

4. After you are in, you need to locate and click on the Cloud icon which will open a window for you to upload your video.

5. Once the video is uploaded, you will be asked to put in a caption. We advise you to keep the caption quirky and fun. Another quick tip is that you should use hashtags that are trending at the moment as that will increase the visual appearance of your video more.

6. Time to choose a cover! Drag the frame to any part of the video to choose the thumbnail that you want as the cover of your content.

 ![Upload tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Upload-tiktok-video.jpg)

7. Lastly, choose the audience of the video according to your preference in the same window.

## Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Windows

As a person who does not own a Mac, you might be wondering if this article is for you or not. From this point onwards, the method will be for people who have a PC. To upload a video to TikTok from a PC, you can follow the same steps as above.

If you wish to up your game and follow the best method and not the simplest one then we have something for you. The answer for many TikTok users is an android emulator.

## A World of Eats: Popular Global Food Delicacies

If you’re using TikTok to watch entertaining content only, you’re missing out on a great deal of valuable content. Content creators from around the world use TikTok to showcase their skills in a wide range of niches, and food is a major one.

We all love local cuisine, but that doesn’t mean we should sway away from trying international cuisine.

For those interested in cooking and eating cuisines loved in other parts of the world – and cuisines that are talked about a lot on TikTok – this article would greatly help.

Let’s explore country-specific food recipes popular on TikTok.

## TikTok Mexican Food

TikTok has brought together people from all over the world who love to share their local food recipes. The app is full of Mexican food recipes, ranging from simple street foods like tacos and soups to rich, complex dishes like Menudo.

![TikTok Mexican food recipes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/popular-food-recipes-1.png)

Some popular TikTok Mexican food recipes include the following:

### ● Gordita

Gordita is a corn flour tortilla stuffed with meat, cheese, or beans. You can also stuff your gordita with sweet ingredients like cajeta (caramelized goat milk) and guava. To make the tortillas, you'll need masa harina, water, and salt. You can find these ingredients at any Latino grocery store or online.

### ● Menudo

Menudo is a spicy soup made with tripe (cow stomach), hominy, and chile peppers usually served with lime wedges and tortillas. It's also known as pancita. Another variation of Menudo is called pozole, which is made with pork or sometimes chicken.

This soup is often used to cure hangovers — it's packed with nutrients that help your body recover after a night of drinking.

### ● Tacos

Another popular TikTok Mexican food is Tacos – a staple of Mexican cuisine. There are different types to choose from. They can be made with vegetables, beans, potatoes, and even cactus. From the classic tacos al pastor to tacos de canasta, these tasty bites are a must-try if you’re into Mexican food.

## TikTok Korean Food

The appeal of the Japanese food trend on TikTok is twofold. Firstly, it offers a way to explore different flavors and textures that may not be totally familiar. Secondly, when it comes to cooking Japanese food at home, many of the videos offer an important shortcut: they help you find easy alternatives to ingredients that are hard to come by.

Som popular Japanese food TikTok include:

### ● Sushi

Sushi is perhaps the most popular Japanese dish outside of Japan. It consists of cooked vinegared rice combined with other ingredients, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes tropical fruits. It’s mostly served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce.

Sushi comes in many types, which include nigiri-zushi (oval-shaped rice topped with a slice of raw fish or seafood). Gunkan-maki is another type of sushi that is seaweed filled with rice and fish roe or other ingredients such as sea urchin roe or oysters.

### ● Hiyashi Chuka

Hiyashi chuka is a cold version of ramen, served with a mix of thinly sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, ham, and eggs. It's normally served during the summer months only.

### ● Shabu Shabu

Shabu shabu is a hot pot dish in which very thinly sliced beef and vegetables are cooked in water or broth and eaten with a dipping sauce. At the table, diners dip their meat and vegetables into the broth to cook them before eating.

### ● Kaiseki

Kaiseki meal is a multi-course meal that combines traditional Japanese aesthetics with seasonal ingredients. The dishes are usually smaller and more intricate than other dishes, making kaiseki one of the most beautiful cuisines in the world.

### ● Yakitori

Yakitori refers to chicken grilled on a skewer and seasoned with salt or tare sauce (a mix of soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar). They can be made from all different parts of the chicken, including breast, thigh, skin and cartilage among other things.

## TikTok African Food

African cuisine is a delight, and TikTok is making it more popular. African food is slowly becoming a trend on TikTok.

![“TikTok African Food](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/popular-food-recipes-5.png)

The continent of Africa is so big that it's hard to generalize about its cuisine, or even to group its cuisines into categories. Even within individual countries or regions, you will find an astonishing variety of foods and flavors.

But there are some common themes that run through most African cuisines:

A preference for starchy staples – such as rice, yams, millet, sorghum, and maize (corn) – paired with sauces made from local ingredients such as tomatoes, leafy greens, peppers, and beans.

### ● Jollof rice

Nigerian jollof rice is one of the country's most popular dishes, and it's become a staple on TikTok. Jollof rice is a rice dish made with tomatoes, green peppers, onion, and spices like ginger, garlic, paprika, and black pepper.

It can be served as a side dish or as a meal with additional ingredients. Some users have added sausages and fried plantains to their jollof rice before serving.

### ● Suya

It’s another popular African food called TikTok. Suya is a snack that can be found all over Nigeria and West Africa. It consists of skewers of meat covered in peanut butter and spices like ginger powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, vegetable oil, and bouillon cubes. The meat can be made from any cut of beef or chicken but traditionally uses beef steak or chicken thigh filet.

### ● Fufu

Fufu is a soft white dough made from cassava or yams flour (also known as cassava flour). It may also be made from plantain or cocoyam. Fufu is normally eaten with stews and soups like Peanut Soup in Ghana, Egusi Soup in Nigeria, etc.

### ● Braai

Braai comes from South Africa's BBQ tradition and is an important part of social gatherings in South Africa. There are several kinds of meat cooked on a grill such as steak, chicken, pork chops, sausages, etc.

## Conclusion

After a long, hard day of work, you simply can’t imagine what to eat. Doesn’t matter if you are exhausted, stressed out, or even in a bad mood; food is the magic elixir that can make your day or spoil it completely.

Eating a tasty meal is one way to relieve stress and refresh yourself. If you need some inspiration for your next cuisine from another country, you will find this collection of popular foods on TikTok very helpful.
