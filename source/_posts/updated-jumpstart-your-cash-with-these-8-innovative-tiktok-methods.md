## Why do you Need to Go Live on TikTok?

Among the emerging platforms, TikTok is becoming a popular one used by more than 600 million users, especially recognized as the ‘lip-syncing app”. It allows users to make live videos, share video clips, add various AR filter effects, and synchronizing with musical tracks.

Globally, Tiktok is in the top 10 social media applications that help create video content in minutes that can be creative or fun-oriented by the inclusion of masks, stickers, effects, sounds, and so on.

Currently, many individuals are interested in making live videos, and this is where the competition between tiktokers rises. The primary users of TikTok are adults and teens-this is what makes TikTok the best live streaming platform.

* Set an appropriate background suitable for the particular situation and get the props if needed.
