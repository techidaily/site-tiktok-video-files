## Part 1: How to Fast Forward on Tiktok When Playing?

TikTok videos include a progress bar, which allows you to jump between them; nevertheless, this feature is not accessible for all videos. For the time being, the function is only visible on lengthier films.

Although it is unlikely, it is also possible to download a TikTok clip and then fast forward or rewind it at your convenience without using the TikTok app. But how to do it is the real question here. Follow the steps below to learn the trick:

**Step 1:** Find a **white progress bar** at the bottom of the clip on TikTok by opening the app and selecting it.

![tiktok video playback white progress bar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-video-playback-white-progress-bar.jpg)

**Step 2:** The dot on the progress bar that appears like a white line may be moved forward or backward by tapping and dragging it along the bar. Note that the revised location will be reflected above the bar in the first timecode number.

**Step 3**: Using your finger, touch on the **White circle** and move it forward or backward to the place indicated by the timecode figure displayed above it.

**Step 4:** When you **let go of the dot**, you would have shifted your position in the clip.
