The platform allows its users to **produce 15-second to one-minute videos** and it offers a rich collection of filters, effects, and music.

In case you want to [edit your TikTok videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with some other app or use them to create videos longer than one minute, you must first **save them to your Smartphone or a computer.** Here's how you can download videos from the TikTok platform.

## Method 1: Downloading Your TikTok Videos to Your Smartphone

All you have to do is launch the TikTok app from your phone and tap on the **Account icon** that is located in the bottom right corner of the app's main window.

![Saving TikTok Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/saving-tiktok-video-smartphone.jpg)

## Method 2: Using the Video Downloader Apps to Download other TikTok Videos

The process of downloading videos to a Smartphone directly from the TikTok app can be quite slow, so if you want to save videos from this video sharing platform to your phone in no time you can try using some of the downloader apps for Musical.ly that are available at the Google Play store.

### Downloading TikTok Videos With the Video Downloader for Musical.ly

Once you've installed the [Video Downloader for Musical.ly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avalon.musically.downloader) on your phone, you should open the TikTok app and locate the video you want to save.
