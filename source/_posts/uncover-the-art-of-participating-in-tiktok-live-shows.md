TikTok has become a very frequently used app globally, however occasionally its users have to confront certain challenges.

* Open the settings and click on the network and internet option. From there, click on the mobile network > Open ‘Advanced Options’

If the issue continues, consider deleting the program and reinstalling it from the App Store for iOS users or Play Store for Android users.

**For iOS:**
