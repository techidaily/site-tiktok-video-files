Let's head towards a step-by-step tutorial on downloading music from TikTok.

#### Step 1: Launch Filmora

First and foremost, you have to launch the software after clicking on the **Download** tab. Then, you will need to install the software. After granting specific permissions, let it begin on your PC.

#### Step 2: Download your favorite TikTok video

Go to TikTok, search your favorite song, and download any particular video on it. It’s pretty simple to download from there. If you're on a laptop, you can right-click the video. Else, you can simply long-press the video on a smartphone and hit **Save Video**.

#### Step 3: Import tik tok video

We downloaded a video by a girl on the song 'All I want for Christmas is You.' Let's extract its audio with the help of the Filmora Audio Extraction feature.

Go to **Media**\> +**Drop** icon button to import the **TikTok song** video.
