Now, double-click the video with the image mask to adjust the properties. Scroll down to the Video Effects field, and you will see the Image Mask. Click the arrow icon to choose a mask preset, adjust its position and size settings to fit the video.

Tips: You can hide the video in track 1 by clicking the eye icon so you can adjust the video with the image mask conveniently. Click it again then you will see the video.

Next, click the video in track 2 again, and then go to the **Transform** tab, use the **Scale** slider to adjust the video size to make a big head effect.
