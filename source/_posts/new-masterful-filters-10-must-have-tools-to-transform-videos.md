We will look at some of the top TikTok filters that make your video stand out from the crowd.

### 1.TikTok's G6 filter

On TikTok, filters are identified by a single maker and number. While G6 is labeled a food-related filter, it's become increasingly popular due to its bright, colorful, and slightly retro feel.

![tiktok g6 filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-g6-filter.jpg)

### 2.TikTok's Anime Filter

When individuals uploaded their Snapchat videos to TikTok, the anime filter became quite popular. This filter transforms you into an animated character, but you'll need to download Snapchat first and get an account if you don't already have one.

![tiktok anime filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-anime-filter.jpeg)

### 3.TikTok’s Invisible filter

Another outcome of viral videos is TikTok's Invisible filter. This one gives you the ability to become invisible, which is fantastic if you've ever wanted to try out that superpower.

![tiktok invisible filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-invisible-filter.jpg)

### 4.TikTok's Bling Effect

The Bling effect is another effect that is likely to appear on your For You page. This effect imitates the flash of a diamond being struck by the sun in different locations across the film.

![tiktok bling effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-bling-filter.jpg)

### 5.TikTok's Disney Effect

The Disney TikTok filter gives you a chance to experience what it's like to be a Disney princess or prince. This effect transforms your face into a Disney-inspired cartoon character.

This filter, like the anime filter, is available on Snapchat. So make sure you've downloaded that app first.

![tiktok disney effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-disney-filter.jpg)

### 6.TikTok Dog Face

The Dog Face filter is another amusing face to experiment on. You get dog ears, a nose, and even a tongue with this one. However, you must record another filter in Snapchat before publishing it to TikTok.

![tiktok dog face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-dog-face.jpg)

### 7.TikTok's Inverted Filter

The Inverted filter is a little more divisive than the others. This filter flips any video you capture, and it's famous for using the front-facing camera because it's said to mimic how other people perceive you. So, what's the big deal about it? On the other hand, the inverted filter has enraged some users, who don't always appreciate their "true" reflection. However, the only way to see what all the fuss (or hysteria) is about is to give it a try.

![tiktok inverted filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-inverted-filter.jpg)

### 8.TikTok's Face Zoom effect

As the name suggests, the Face Zoom effect zooms-in on your face. Some people use it in group videos to see which face the filter lands on, while others use the same to compare how you look up close versus how you look from a distance.

![tiktok face zoom effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-face-zoom-effect.jpg)

### 9.TikTok's Face Morph

The Face Morph effect is another popular effect. This one lets you morph and transition between multiple images of someone else's face. The effect may be under TikTok's Templates area because it employs graphics rather than video.

![tiktok face morph](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-face-morph.jpg)

### 2.TikTok's Anime Filter

When individuals uploaded their Snapchat videos to TikTok, the anime filter became quite popular. This filter transforms you into an animated character, but you'll need to download Snapchat first and get an account if you don't already have one.

![tiktok anime filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-anime-filter.jpeg)

### 3.TikTok’s Invisible filter

Another outcome of viral videos is TikTok's Invisible filter. This one gives you the ability to become invisible, which is fantastic if you've ever wanted to try out that superpower.

### 4.TikTok's Bling Effect

The Bling effect is another effect that is likely to appear on your For You page. This effect imitates the flash of a diamond being struck by the sun in different locations across the film.

### 5.TikTok's Disney Effect

The Disney TikTok filter gives you a chance to experience what it's like to be a Disney princess or prince. This effect transforms your face into a Disney-inspired cartoon character.

This filter, like the anime filter, is available on Snapchat. So make sure you've downloaded that app first.

![tiktok disney effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-disney-filter.jpg)

### 6.TikTok Dog Face

The Dog Face filter is another amusing face to experiment on. You get dog ears, a nose, and even a tongue with this one. However, you must record another filter in Snapchat before publishing it to TikTok.

![tiktok dog face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-dog-face.jpg)

### 7.TikTok's Inverted Filter

The Inverted filter is a little more divisive than the others. This filter flips any video you capture, and it's famous for using the front-facing camera because it's said to mimic how other people perceive you. So, what's the big deal about it? On the other hand, the inverted filter has enraged some users, who don't always appreciate their "true" reflection. However, the only way to see what all the fuss (or hysteria) is about is to give it a try.

![tiktok inverted filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-inverted-filter.jpg)

### 8.TikTok's Face Zoom effect

As the name suggests, the Face Zoom effect zooms-in on your face. Some people use it in group videos to see which face the filter lands on, while others use the same to compare how you look up close versus how you look from a distance.

![tiktok face zoom effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-face-zoom-effect.jpg)

### 9.TikTok's Face Morph

The Face Morph effect is another popular effect. This one lets you morph and transition between multiple images of someone else's face. The effect may be under TikTok's Templates area because it employs graphics rather than video.

![tiktok face morph](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/tiktok-filter-face-morph.jpg)

### 10.TikTok's Beauty Filter

For obvious reasons, the Beauty filter is popular on TikTok. It improves your appearance by evening out skin tone, adding color, and improving overall appearance. It's commonly useful in conjunction with other filters and effects.

## Special Effects That Can Make Your Tiktok Dance Routine Special

Tik Tok comes with various options of different effects on its own. Whenever you make a video on Tik Tok, you can easily add effects from the app after you are done recording. Nevertheless, there is always a limit to the number of effects offered by the app.

You can however add effects to your content via different applications. One of the best and most amazing video effects you can add to your videos is motion tracking. Motion tracking function allows any sticker or animation to follow your actions.

For that execution, you will need an external video editing app to edit your videos. [Wondershare’s FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is recommended to be the best video editing software used for these purposes.

2.Now you will want to check that the main body of the subject is in the entire frame. If it is not, then you will need to cut and trim the video accordingly.

3.The next step is to start the motion tracking. For this, you will need to make sure that your play head is at the point from where you want to start your motion tracking. The tracking will only start wherever your play head is.

4.Once that is done, you can open the tool used for motion tracking from the timeline toolbar. You can also do it by double-clicking your clip to find the motion tracking function in the editing menu.

5.When you have done that, the motion tracking box will appear in the preview. Move and resize it according to the subject that you wish to track. Then, select the “render-effect” option so that Filmora can analyze the video.

7.Once you choose your object, you simply need to drag that object to the track above your footage.

8.Next, you will need to place the object where you want it to be concerning the subject in the preview box. Make sure that you drag the edge of it on the timeline to match it with the timeline of your subject.

9.When it has been set up, you will need to double-click the footage you have added the tracking function to and go to the motion tracking menu.

10.The drop-down menu will show all the texts and images or animations available. Select the one you want to see.

11.Adjust the size of your object and voila!! You are done.
