For readers who have installed [Wondershare Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)on Windows and Mac computers, you can use it to remove watermarks from the downloaded TikTok videos in several ways. To execute these easy modifying tasks, you don't need to be an accomplished editor. All you have to do is pick a technique that best meets your needs and follow an essential, easy-to-learn step. Let's take a look at several Filmora editing procedures for removing TikTok watermarks from videos on Windows and Mac.

### Method 1: Replace the Watermark

**Step 1:** Drag and drop the downloaded TikTok video to Filmora timeline, and then upload your own logo to hide the TikTok video.

**Step 2:** Adjust the size and position of the logo and then set the logo duration as long as the original file so that the watermark stays covered throughout.

### Method 2: Crop the Video

**Step 1:**  right-click the video in the timeline and then choose **Crop** and **Zoom**.

**Step 2:** To erase the watermark from the framework, rearrange the edges of the cropping rectangle by dragging it as far as desired.

**Step 3**: You've successfully erased a watermark from your movie by clicking **OK** to perform the cropping effect.

### Method 3: Blurring the Watermark

## Part 3: Why You Shouldn't Remove the Watermark from TikTok Videos?

People have divided opinions when it comes to keeping the watermark logo or getting rid of it entirely. Understandably, the TikTok emblem can be bothersome to specific users because it seems an "extra" item on the screen rather than a part of the content.

Yet, this does not imply that we support or urge its removal. If you're seeking to promote your content across many channels, you must retain the watermark since it allows the creator of the content to be correctly recognized.

## Part 4: FAQs About Downloading TikTok Video

**1\. Why Can't I Download Some TikTok Videos?**

There could be a few reasons for you not being able to download some TikTok videos. One of the foremost is that the video creator has disabled video downloads. Other causes include insufficient memory, account problems, internet connectivity issues, and an old version of TikTok on your smartphone.

**2\. How Many Videos Can I Download from TikTok?**

In most cases, there is no restriction to how many videos you can download on TikTok. You are free to download an unlimited number of TikTok videos.

**3\. How to Get the TikTok Video Link on iPhone and Android?**

First, you need to head over to your profile section and click on the three-dot option present in the top right corner. Tap on Manage Account and then select Switch to My Pro Account. Now you will see two options: Creator and Business. Use the Business option to choose one category and press on Next to advance. Now you will see a link in your profile bio. You can further add the link to the Website section of the profile according to your liking.

**Conclusion**

Well, there you have it – your best **Video Downloader TikTok No Watermark** software, to make downloading TikTok videos a breeze for you. It's completely normal to like a video and want to download it but not be a fan of those watermarks. Therefore, it's best to have applications that support your narrative. We suggest using **_Wondershare Filmora_** to get the best insights into removing watermarks when downloading TikTok videos. The software has many excellent features that help you with the video editing in the best way possible!
