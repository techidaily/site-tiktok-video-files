## Part 1: Does TikTok Tell You Who Viewed Your Profile?

The answer is NO. TikTok lacks a feature that allows users to see which accounts have viewed their videos. It means that while you may not see who is viewing your videos, your viewing habits are also left anonymous. Thus, you wouldn't be able to access the TikTok profile view.

TikTok only indicates how many people viewed the post instead of showing who has viewed your videos profile.

TikTok users can see who comments on their videos as well as who creates "duets" or "stitches" (essentially video edits) of their content using the **Activity** tab on the app.

## Part 2: How to View Someone's TikTok Profile without them Knowing?

To view someone's profile without them knowing, you need to upgrade to the latest updated TikTok app. TikTok will only indicate the number of viewers but no further information on who those viewers are.

It means you are already viewing others' TikTok profiles without them knowing.

## Part 3: How to Change Profile Picture on TikTok

You've got only two ways to represent yourself on TikTok with your profile picture and videos. Of course, the profile picture you put shows up on the profile page and every video posted.

Like many other apps, your profile icon can get changed whenever you feel like it. TikTok has an added advantage since it gives more options for changing your icon. You can have a profile video.

Additionally, there's an easy way to download a profile picture you like on someone else's profile.

**Steps to change your profile picture on TikTok**

You can pick a photo you have saved or take a new one when you change your picture. Make sure you've kept the image you wish to upload before proceeding.

Step 1: Open TikTok and head to your profile by tapping the Profile option in the bottom-right corner.

Step 2: Tap the Edit profile option.

Step 3: Select either **Change photo** or **Change video**, depending on what you want. If you're changing the photograph, you can take a new one or select the one you had saved earlier; if you're adding a video, choose the one you've saved already.

A quick tip: Any video uploaded needs to be between three and six seconds long. A longer one will have to get trimmed first.

Your desired profile photo or video will be uploaded immediately and appear on your profile. Whenever you want to change your profile video or image again, repeat the abovementioned steps.

**Note**: If you've uploaded both a picture and a video, the video is always what will appear as your profile icon. If you want people to see the image instead, head back to the **Edit profile** menu for the TikTok profile view, tap your video, and select **Remove video**.

## Part 4: How to Edit TikTok Profile on PC (Include already uploaded TikTok)?

On the already updated TikTok, it is impossible to change the profile picture on PC because it is limited. The only possible way to make changes is through an Android or iOS device. However, if using a PC and need to make those changes, you can use TikTok on BlueStacks with zero troubles.

BlueStacks acts as an android emulator, which enables the running of the TikTok mobile app on the PC. You will only need to save the video or image on BlueStacks by using the option 'Save to Album.' For all this to be possible, first update the graphics driver and allocate a minimum of 1500MB RAM. After opening the app, navigate to the 'App Centre' then sign in with your Google account. Type 'TikTok' and then click it to install and open at the search option.

## Part 4: How to Edit TikTok Profile on PC (Include already uploaded TikTok)?

On the already updated TikTok, it is impossible to change the profile picture on PC because it is limited. The only possible way to make changes is through an Android or iOS device. However, if using a PC and need to make those changes, you can use TikTok on BlueStacks with zero troubles.

BlueStacks acts as an android emulator, which enables the running of the TikTok mobile app on the PC. You will only need to save the video or image on BlueStacks by using the option 'Save to Album.' For all this to be possible, first update the graphics driver and allocate a minimum of 1500MB RAM. After opening the app, navigate to the 'App Centre' then sign in with your Google account. Type 'TikTok' and then click it to install and open at the search option.

## Part 2: Best 20 TikTok Caption Ideas of 2022

Coming up with a good Tiktok video may be challenging because it is not about getting into a lovely place and beginning to shoot some videos. Yes, you might have all the resources but lack a good caption. Make your video the best by being creative. Aesthetic usernames for TikTok, complemented with a caption, will boost your views. A caption will determine whether your video gets viewed by many people or a few people. Therefore, consider investing time in creating a nice one that will market your video out there. If you don't have spare time for all that, here are some of the best captions you can use.

### Funny Captions

1\. “Getting the best house for your content.”

2\. "Best dancing moves are never created unless they check out mine."

3\. "It's the dancing captain on the move."

4\. "Here's why Dunkin Donuts is going to give me his hand."

5\. "Already famous on TikTok? This is how I made it."

### Cute captions

1\. “No one can challenge me unless I accept defeat.”

2\. “Do this to find love on TikTok.”

3\. “No dancing, no life.”

4\. “I’m the one to receive the audio reward.”

5\. “A true friend must include you on Tiktok.”

### Quote Captions

1\. "Dance is the hidden soul's language" - Martha Graham

2\. “The job of feet is walking, but their hobby is dancing.”- Amit Kalantri

3\. "Dancing is a perpendicular horizontal desire." - George Bernard Shaw

4\. "Those who were observed dancing were said to be insane by those who could not feel the music" - Friedrich Nietzsche

5\. "Every day offers an opportunity for you to draw in a breath. Kick-off your shoes. And dance." - Oprah Winfrey.

### Specifically, for slay queens (isn't it ironic?)

1\. A hardworking daddy who never ceases to provide for the family

2\. I’m just kidding to see your response

3\. I can’t stop enjoying life

4\. Whoever knows the secret of money will stop looking for it.

5\. I think I’m the best of the best.
