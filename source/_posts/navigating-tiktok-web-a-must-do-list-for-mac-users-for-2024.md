## 2. What Should You Do if TikTok Web Stops Functioning Properly?

The technology behind TikTok is pretty much flawless. If the website is not working, then we would recommend:

1. That you check your internet connection. A stable internet connection will give you the best user experience.
2. If the website is still is not loading then go to the browser’s settings and clear out related caches and cookies.

If you are facing some other kind of problem then you can always directly contact the support team at TikTok.

1. Go to your profile by clicking on **Me**.![titok me screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/TikTok-Me-Screen-.png)

After Vine had been shut down a few years back, it left a gaping hole in the heart of the users. But, later on, they discovered TikTok. It is a social media platform where users post short 15 seconds video clips. The video ranges from dance challenges to pranks. In fact, you will also find videos of pets dressed funnily.

TikTok is a social media network that had a meteoric rise. The platform saw a significant rise in creative short sketches that are similar to Vine skits.
