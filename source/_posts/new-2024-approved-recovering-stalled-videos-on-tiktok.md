According to the Community Guidelines of TikTok, users cannot post, send, or share any content that violates someone else's trademarks, copyrights, or intellectual property rights.

To prevent this, TikTok applies a watermark featuring both its account’s username and the logo that originally posted the content if someone downloads a TikTok video.
