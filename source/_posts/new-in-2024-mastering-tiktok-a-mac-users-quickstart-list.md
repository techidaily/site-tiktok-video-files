### Pointers for Using TikTok on Mac

Are you finding it impossible to find information about using TikTok on Mac and are near to giving up? Do not despair just yet because we have gathered most of the information for you.

## 1. How to Use TikTok on Mac?

You can use TikTok on your Mac through the official website of TikTok.

1. Open your web browser and go to the official website where you will need to log in.
2. You will find the Log in button on the top right of the window.
3. Once you have entered your login details, you will be able to enjoy the platform.

![log-in-to-TikTok-web](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/tiktok-web.jpg)

We would like to add that when you are using TikTok on your Mac, you can upload already edited videos without any trouble. There is not one specified Tiktok video editing software available but you can utilize Wondershare Filmora for Mac as that seems to be the top choice among users these days.

## 2. What Should You Do if TikTok Web Stops Functioning Properly?

The technology behind TikTok is pretty much flawless. If the website is not working, then we would recommend:

1. That you check your internet connection. A stable internet connection will give you the best user experience.
2. If the website is still is not loading then go to the browser’s settings and clear out related caches and cookies.

If you are facing some other kind of problem then you can always directly contact the support team at TikTok.
