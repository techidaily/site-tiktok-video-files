Some of the most popular Italian food TikTok include the following:

### ● Pasta

Pasta is an ever-green Italian dish and is quite popular on TikTok, with many people sharing their recipes. Typically, pasta is made from an unleavened dough of durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. It can also be made with flour from other cereals or grains. Pasta may be divided into two broad categories, dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca).

### ● Kaiseki

### ● Suya

It’s another popular African food called TikTok. Suya is a snack that can be found all over Nigeria and West Africa. It consists of skewers of meat covered in peanut butter and spices like ginger powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, vegetable oil, and bouillon cubes. The meat can be made from any cut of beef or chicken but traditionally uses beef steak or chicken thigh filet.

### ● Fufu

Fufu is a soft white dough made from cassava or yams flour (also known as cassava flour). It may also be made from plantain or cocoyam. Fufu is normally eaten with stews and soups like Peanut Soup in Ghana, Egusi Soup in Nigeria, etc.
