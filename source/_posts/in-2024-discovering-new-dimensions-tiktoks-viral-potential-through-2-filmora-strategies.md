Although there is no method to delete the duet videos that others have created with you, yes, you can prevent it in the future by using app settings. By doing this, you are keeping your profile publicly visible, but you are not allowing other people to create a duet with you. If you want to do such settings; go through the steps below.

Step 1: First of all, open the app and then go to privacy settings.

Step 2: Now move to the Safety option.
