## Part 2: How to Use Cool TikTok Photo Editing Hacks?

Most of the TikTok users only take the assistance of the app to edit their videos on the go. Though, a **TikTok picture edit trend** is lately going viral on the social media platform.

The hack would make your photos look more vibrant and colorful while still maintaining their authenticity. Here’s how you can also implement this TikTok iPhone photo editing hack without any hassle:

1. At first, you can just go to the Photos app, open any picture, and click on the “Edit” button from the top.
2. Once the editing interface of the photo is opened, you can go to its Exposure field and set it to its maximum value, which is 100 (please note that this is an optional step).
3. Great! Now, go to the “Highlights” field and set its value to negative 35.
4. Afterward, change the “Shadow” effect to a negative 28 value and keep the “Contrast” value to minus 30.

1. Now, you can set the “Brightness” value to minus 5 and the “Back Point” value to exact 10.
2. You are almost there. You can now put the “Saturation” value to 10 and keep its “Vibrance” level to 8.
3. Furthermore, go to the “Warmth” field and keep it to 10 while its “Tint” value has to be set to 39.
4. Besides that, you also have to set its “Sharpness” count to 14 and the “Vignette” value to 23.
