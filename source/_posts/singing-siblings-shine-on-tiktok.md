**Step 9:** If you are making a TikTok reaction video using Filmora, then you can easily play two videos side-by-side. You need to place two different videos in two different tracks in Filmora. Then select the first video and adjust the size of the video so that it covers the half area in the preview window. Then repeat the septs to cover the other half of the preview window. By doing this, you can easily make a reaction video in just a few minutes.

**Step 10:** You can add your favorite music to the background of your videos. Just import the music file to Filmora and add it to the music track in the timeline. Adjust the length of the music according to the length of the video, and it will be added to the background. You can also use the volume controls to adjust the loudness.

**Step 11:** Once you are satisfied with your video, all you need to do is export it to your system in your desired format and share it with your audience on TikTok.
