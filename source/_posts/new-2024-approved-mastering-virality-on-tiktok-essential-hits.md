Nowadays, you are either a TikTok influencer, or a follower, or a critic!

The revolutionary Chinese social network amasses video clips of the max length of 60 seconds, ideally shot on simple mobile phones, created easily and published for free. TikTok now seems to be a part of everyone's life through the most popular lip-syncing videos, one-act dance routines, 1-min recipes, funny clips, and stuff like the bottle cap challenge.

More or less the heart and soul of today's teenagers and young adults, and sometimes even senior citizens, TikTok now has over 1 billion users and became the World's 7th most downloaded app, all within a span of 3years since its release in 2016.

What started with fun and games has become a serious platform to showcase one's talent and gain followers, earn money, and even stardom. Such provisions have stirred fierce competition among influencers, for what seems like the Wars of Creativity to publish more and more viral-worthy videos.

If you are an influencer looking for new and amazing **TikTok ideas** to make your videos go viral, then here is a stimulus.

* [Part 2: Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers](#part2)

## TikTok vs YouTube

TikTok may be one of a kind, but it is not the only platform where you can publish your mobile-made videos without much ado. The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.

#### Nature of Content

The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.

#### User Base

TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.

#### Outreach

TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one's talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.

Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.

## Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers

#### 1\. Music Videos

A common theme of most viral TikTok videos is they tend to be cute and cuddly. As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.

Here is an example of [a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/)

#### 2\. Dance Videos

If it is short, funny, and uses the correct hashtags, your dance video can create a lot of influence among your followers. Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.

This is a good example of what [your dance video should look like](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/). Now isn’t that the perfect ingredient for the next viral meme on the market!

#### 3\. Calming Videos

Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.

Look at this video of [color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/). Did that not calm your mind?

#### 4\. Objects Singing Videos

One of the viral TikTok memes had several objects singing Adele’s hit number “ Someone Like You”. This could be something for you to base your ideas on for a new viral video. Use any object around the house, not even necessary that it should move about. The trick lies in finding the right song to pair with, something that will lend a soul to the object and give the impression of the performance coming from a real person.

#### 5\. Art Videos

This one is for all the artists out there. If you are someone who creates figurines, pictures, or any other form of art, then don’t let your creative process go unnoticed – rather, film it and put it up as a Tik Tok video. The social media platform has many takers for such videos that show the process behind every creative job as it helps give a view into the thought process of an artist, however minute. This is also a good way for you to promote your work on social media, helping you gain greater exposure in the long run. Add some creative twists to these videos and help them stand out in the crowd.

Skip the commentary and speed up the videos but make sure they are of self-explanatory nature.

Use the shots where you get the sincerest reactions to come up with the most interesting clips.

As long as you keep it hilarious, your fans will love it.

Love for the environment, gender diversity, anti-racism, are some of the genres you can work with. The more resounding your message, the more will be the views it generates. Ensure your new lyrics are in tune with the overall tempo of the song and focus on keeping it positive.

More or less the heart and soul of today's teenagers and young adults, and sometimes even senior citizens, TikTok now has over 1 billion users and became the World's 7th most downloaded app, all within a span of 3years since its release in 2016.

What started with fun and games has become a serious platform to showcase one's talent and gain followers, earn money, and even stardom. Such provisions have stirred fierce competition among influencers, for what seems like the Wars of Creativity to publish more and more viral-worthy videos.

If you are an influencer looking for new and amazing **TikTok ideas** to make your videos go viral, then here is a stimulus.

* [Part 1: TikTok vs YouTube](#part1)
* [Part 2: Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers](#part2)

## TikTok vs YouTube

TikTok may be one of a kind, but it is not the only platform where you can publish your mobile-made videos without much ado. The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.

#### Nature of Content

The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.

#### User Base

TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.

#### Outreach

TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one's talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.

Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.

## Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers

#### 1\. Music Videos

A common theme of most viral TikTok videos is they tend to be cute and cuddly. As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.

Here is an example of [a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/)

#### 2\. Dance Videos

If it is short, funny, and uses the correct hashtags, your dance video can create a lot of influence among your followers. Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.

This is a good example of what [your dance video should look like](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/). Now isn’t that the perfect ingredient for the next viral meme on the market!

#### 3\. Calming Videos

Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.

Look at this video of [color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/). Did that not calm your mind?

#### 4\. Objects Singing Videos

One of the viral TikTok memes had several objects singing Adele’s hit number “ Someone Like You”. This could be something for you to base your ideas on for a new viral video. Use any object around the house, not even necessary that it should move about. The trick lies in finding the right song to pair with, something that will lend a soul to the object and give the impression of the performance coming from a real person.

See if [Pikachu and his orchestra can provide you with some inspiration](https://twitter.com/i/status/1079418894538940418)

#### 5\. Art Videos

This one is for all the artists out there. If you are someone who creates figurines, pictures, or any other form of art, then don’t let your creative process go unnoticed – rather, film it and put it up as a Tik Tok video. The social media platform has many takers for such videos that show the process behind every creative job as it helps give a view into the thought process of an artist, however minute. This is also a good way for you to promote your work on social media, helping you gain greater exposure in the long run. Add some creative twists to these videos and help them stand out in the crowd.

Here is someone [showing off their artistic skills](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxvZ78YHEUf/)

#### 6.1-Minute Recipes

If you are a cooking aficionado and often dabble around in the kitchen for preparing new recipes, then TikTok is a good place to share your cooking videos. While fitting in the entire video into a matter of a few seconds can prove difficult, it is certainly not impossible. Skip the commentary and speed up the videos but make sure they are of self-explanatory nature. If cooking is not your thing, you can also post videos of what you eat every day – there is a sizable follower base for that category as well!

Chef Shereen will show you [how to cook a Santa Claus Melon](https://www.tiktok.com/@cookingwithshereen/video/6841303083289464070) here

#### 7\. Animal Videos

Oh, those amazing creations of the Almighty! When it comes to cute pet clips, there is very little you can go wrong with. Be it tricks, reaction to your singing, or simply them having a jolly good time, there is always a lot of attention on pets. If you have not done so already, it is time to capture the acts of your pets on camera and start pulling in the followers. The music needs to be as adorable as the pets themselves and make sure they are at ease doing what you ask them to do. The more authentic the reaction, the more attention your video will get. Use the shots where you get the sincerest reactions to come up with the most interesting clips.

Just look at this [adorable little doggo](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLCv72DpcY/)

#### 8\. Funny TikTok Ideas

Narrate funny stories with your twist in the narrative, few sources of entertainment can be as good! Even asking a simple question could count under this category. Don’t be dissuaded by the short time frame. You can also come up with your own stories about things you observed around you on a day-to-day basis. As long as you keep it hilarious, your fans will love it.

#### 9\. Words of Positivity

You are sure to have a favorite song. How about tweaking the lyrics a bit to make it sound more current, something that fits in better with current sentiments? Love for the environment, gender diversity, anti-racism, are some of the genres you can work with. The more resounding your message, the more will be the views it generates. Ensure your new lyrics are in tune with the overall tempo of the song and focus on keeping it positive.

Here is someone [promoting respect for women](https://twitter.com/i/status/1081608132382609413)

#### 10\. Challenges

Social media challenges such as the Ice Bucket Challenge usually never fail to go viral. So, if you are looking to boost your follower base, go ahead and take up a trending challenge and post it on TikTok. You may create your challenge and set trends for others to follow.

Here is an interesting challenge that even had [US Senator Elizabeth Warren chipping in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv90UabzuBM)
