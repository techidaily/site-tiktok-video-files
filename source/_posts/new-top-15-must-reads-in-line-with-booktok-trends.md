I have to admit the shortcuts of growing TikTok followers are really attractive. However, every coin has two sides. Have you ever thought about the engagement rate of your content if the followers are not real? In the long run, I suggest you could try other tips to skyrocket growth On TikTok. Just keep reading.

## How to Get Free Followers on TikTok?

Creating short music videos and posting them online, demands a lot of work because you have to select the song you're going to use, capture the footage perfectly and edit it before you can share a video on your TikTok profile. Throughout all of the stages of this process, there are things you can do that can help you attract a broad audience, so let's take a look at some of the best ways to increase the reach of your videos.

#### 1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers

This is a simple and effective way to gain the attention of TikTok's most influential users. Pinpoint the most successful Musers in your niche and follow and unfollow them until they follow you back. Although it may seem silly, this strategy actually works, because, after enough attempts, your favorite members of the platform will look at your profile, and follow you back if they like what they see. Try to comment on their videos, because TikTok stars share on their profiles can potentially increase the chances of being followed back, especially if your comments are always on point. Some of the people whose work you appreciate maybe even willing to share their secrets and help you get more followers.

#### 2. Make Your Profile Look Charming

![Charming Profile on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/charming-profile-on-tiktok.jpg)

Every little detail matters when it comes to optimizing your profile. The profile picture, username, or the personal information you provide can all leave a strong impression on people who visit your profile. A long username that is hard to remember isn't going to help you gain more recognition, mostly because everyone is going to forget it soon after they hear it. Pick a short and catchy username that stands out and try avoiding using different usernames on different social media accounts. Let others know what types of videos they can expect from you by mentioning that you love making fitness videos, vlogs, or simple music videos in which you showcase your singing talents. However, it is also indispensable to be as specific as you can, so besides saying that you're producing fitness videos, it's also helpful if you mention that you're making yoga or aerobics videos. Your profile is the first step to establishing communication with new followers, which is why it is important to do everything you can to encourage others to hit the follow button and start communicating with you.

#### 3. Participate in Viral Challenges

Following the latest social media trends is necessary because it enables you to see what other types of content are popular at the moment. Viral challenges, like the recent Kiki challenge, often involve singing and dancing to a popular song, which is why they are a great choice of content for the TikTok platform that is mostly dedicated to music videos. Using trending hashtags in the posts you share on your profile will make your viral challenge videos visible to millions of people, and it can increase your number of followers drastically in just a few days. In addition, a challenge can inspire you to explore a specific topic or a music genre further and help you build an easily recognizable style that can expand the size of your fanbase.

#### 4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks

Don't limit yourself to just one social media account because if you do so, you won't be able to reach the audiences on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Facebook alone has 2 billion active users each month, while the size of the audience on YouTube isn't much smaller. Managing accounts on several social networks under the same name is also an effective way to build your online reputation because people will remember the name they saw on one platform. As a result, they will start following you on the other. Posting music and all various types of videos on multiple social media accounts also means that they are going to be shared by a larger number of people.

#### 5. Don't Hesitate to Collaborate with Others

Being a one-man or a one-woman show doesn't always pay off, especially if you're just starting out. Recording a duo with an equally talented friend or making any other type of collab video can have a positive impact on the size of your fanbase. It is important to choose the people you work with carefully because content creators that already have a lot of followers might not be interested in collaborating with you if the number of followers you have is significantly lower than theirs. The people you choose to work with should also share your passion for the type of video you're hoping to create since there is no point in inviting someone to make a comedy video with you if their main interest is in fashion. After selecting the person, you're going to collaborate with. You can use the TikTok's Duet option that offers an easy way to create a music video with someone who shares your taste in music.

#### 6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos

All videos, regardless of how short they are, benefit from the video editing process. You don't have to use professional [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut to edit the videos you share on TikTok, because some other video editing apps offer more eye-catching filters and effects to make a captivating short music video. One of them is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The TikTok app enables you to remove all unwanted parts of the video clips you recorded, and it also features a rich library of visual effects, but it lacks some more advanced video editing options. If you'd like to create the ghost effect or to clone yourself using apps such as Video Star, Triller or MuStar is a much better option, because they offer a wider range of video editing tools than TikTok. You can also learn more user-created content from [User Gallery](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to empower video creation.

#### 7. Be Unique and Innovative

Find your own voice, because everyone else's voice is already taken. If you try to imitate the content other creators produce, you'll never find your own distinctive style. What's more, the viewers of your video can easily see if you're really enjoying making the video or not, and in many cases, that may be the reason why they decide to skip hitting the follow button. Chose topics that you're passionate about because if you're just following the trends, the content you produce may seem generic. Don't be afraid to think out of the box and do something new every once in a while. Just to see how your followers react. More often than not, you'll discover something your fans adore, and you'll attract new followers that liked your eagerness to try out new things.

#### 8. Keep Things Short and Concise

It is not possible to record videos with the TikTok app that last longer than sixty seconds. Therefore, sticking to the one-minute limit is probably the best way to ensure that your followers watch all videos you post on your account from the beginning until the end. There is no time limit for videos you upload to your account, so you can use your phone's camera app to make videos that are longer than one minute. However, you should tread carefully since the longer duration of a video can discourage viewers from watching the entire video. Producing short music videos can be a challenging task, but it is also a great way to showcase your creativity and inspire others to follow your work.

#### 9. You're Entertainer, Act Like One

![Entertainer on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/entertainer-on-tiktok.jpg)

How can you expect others to have fun while watching your videos, if you don't have fun making them? Be spontaneous, and enjoy your time in front of the camera. That way you can always keep the spectator guessing what you're going to do next. Put on a good show, that will leave the viewers of your videos wanting to see more. You can accomplish this by adding a lot of humor to the video or by simply enjoying the moment and going with the flow. Even though there are no recipes to the success of the content you post on the TikTok platform, focusing on your performance while remembering to be funny at times is going to help you increase the number of followers.

#### 10. Post New Content At Magic Hours

Sharing new content at least twice a day will eventually get you a massive following, because it will improve the exposure your videos are getting, but you also have to post videos at the right time. The magic posting hours on TikTok are between 11 am and 5 pm as your followers and their friends are most likely to use the app in that time frame. Get to know your audience and try to understand how frequently and at which hours they're using the TikTok app. This will help you create a posting schedule that minimizes the chances of posting videos during parts of the day when they get the least amount of exposure.

**Conclusion**

Be different, be unique, and provide high-quality entertainment to your followers. Try to offer something fresh that will sweep your audience off their feet. The TikTok app features a nearly endless supply of music and video editing options that enable you to express your creativity freely. However, just producing great videos is not enough to attract large audiences since you also have to employ your marketing skills if you want to grow your fanbase.

I have to admit the shortcuts of growing TikTok followers are really attractive. However, every coin has two sides. Have you ever thought about the engagement rate of your content if the followers are not real? In the long run, I suggest you could try other tips to skyrocket growth On TikTok. Just keep reading.

## How to Get Free Followers on TikTok?

Creating short music videos and posting them online, demands a lot of work because you have to select the song you're going to use, capture the footage perfectly and edit it before you can share a video on your TikTok profile. Throughout all of the stages of this process, there are things you can do that can help you attract a broad audience, so let's take a look at some of the best ways to increase the reach of your videos.

#### 1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers

This is a simple and effective way to gain the attention of TikTok's most influential users. Pinpoint the most successful Musers in your niche and follow and unfollow them until they follow you back. Although it may seem silly, this strategy actually works, because, after enough attempts, your favorite members of the platform will look at your profile, and follow you back if they like what they see. Try to comment on their videos, because TikTok stars share on their profiles can potentially increase the chances of being followed back, especially if your comments are always on point. Some of the people whose work you appreciate maybe even willing to share their secrets and help you get more followers.

#### 2. Make Your Profile Look Charming

![Charming Profile on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/charming-profile-on-tiktok.jpg)

Every little detail matters when it comes to optimizing your profile. The profile picture, username, or the personal information you provide can all leave a strong impression on people who visit your profile. A long username that is hard to remember isn't going to help you gain more recognition, mostly because everyone is going to forget it soon after they hear it. Pick a short and catchy username that stands out and try avoiding using different usernames on different social media accounts. Let others know what types of videos they can expect from you by mentioning that you love making fitness videos, vlogs, or simple music videos in which you showcase your singing talents. However, it is also indispensable to be as specific as you can, so besides saying that you're producing fitness videos, it's also helpful if you mention that you're making yoga or aerobics videos. Your profile is the first step to establishing communication with new followers, which is why it is important to do everything you can to encourage others to hit the follow button and start communicating with you.

#### 3. Participate in Viral Challenges

Following the latest social media trends is necessary because it enables you to see what other types of content are popular at the moment. Viral challenges, like the recent Kiki challenge, often involve singing and dancing to a popular song, which is why they are a great choice of content for the TikTok platform that is mostly dedicated to music videos. Using trending hashtags in the posts you share on your profile will make your viral challenge videos visible to millions of people, and it can increase your number of followers drastically in just a few days. In addition, a challenge can inspire you to explore a specific topic or a music genre further and help you build an easily recognizable style that can expand the size of your fanbase.

#### 4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks

Don't limit yourself to just one social media account because if you do so, you won't be able to reach the audiences on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Facebook alone has 2 billion active users each month, while the size of the audience on YouTube isn't much smaller. Managing accounts on several social networks under the same name is also an effective way to build your online reputation because people will remember the name they saw on one platform. As a result, they will start following you on the other. Posting music and all various types of videos on multiple social media accounts also means that they are going to be shared by a larger number of people.

#### 5. Don't Hesitate to Collaborate with Others

Being a one-man or a one-woman show doesn't always pay off, especially if you're just starting out. Recording a duo with an equally talented friend or making any other type of collab video can have a positive impact on the size of your fanbase. It is important to choose the people you work with carefully because content creators that already have a lot of followers might not be interested in collaborating with you if the number of followers you have is significantly lower than theirs. The people you choose to work with should also share your passion for the type of video you're hoping to create since there is no point in inviting someone to make a comedy video with you if their main interest is in fashion. After selecting the person, you're going to collaborate with. You can use the TikTok's Duet option that offers an easy way to create a music video with someone who shares your taste in music.

#### 6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos

All videos, regardless of how short they are, benefit from the video editing process. You don't have to use professional [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut to edit the videos you share on TikTok, because some other video editing apps offer more eye-catching filters and effects to make a captivating short music video. One of them is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The TikTok app enables you to remove all unwanted parts of the video clips you recorded, and it also features a rich library of visual effects, but it lacks some more advanced video editing options. If you'd like to create the ghost effect or to clone yourself using apps such as Video Star, Triller or MuStar is a much better option, because they offer a wider range of video editing tools than TikTok. You can also learn more user-created content from [User Gallery](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to empower video creation.

#### 7. Be Unique and Innovative

Find your own voice, because everyone else's voice is already taken. If you try to imitate the content other creators produce, you'll never find your own distinctive style. What's more, the viewers of your video can easily see if you're really enjoying making the video or not, and in many cases, that may be the reason why they decide to skip hitting the follow button. Chose topics that you're passionate about because if you're just following the trends, the content you produce may seem generic. Don't be afraid to think out of the box and do something new every once in a while. Just to see how your followers react. More often than not, you'll discover something your fans adore, and you'll attract new followers that liked your eagerness to try out new things.

#### 8. Keep Things Short and Concise

It is not possible to record videos with the TikTok app that last longer than sixty seconds. Therefore, sticking to the one-minute limit is probably the best way to ensure that your followers watch all videos you post on your account from the beginning until the end. There is no time limit for videos you upload to your account, so you can use your phone's camera app to make videos that are longer than one minute. However, you should tread carefully since the longer duration of a video can discourage viewers from watching the entire video. Producing short music videos can be a challenging task, but it is also a great way to showcase your creativity and inspire others to follow your work.

#### 9. You're Entertainer, Act Like One

![Entertainer on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/entertainer-on-tiktok.jpg)

How can you expect others to have fun while watching your videos, if you don't have fun making them? Be spontaneous, and enjoy your time in front of the camera. That way you can always keep the spectator guessing what you're going to do next. Put on a good show, that will leave the viewers of your videos wanting to see more. You can accomplish this by adding a lot of humor to the video or by simply enjoying the moment and going with the flow. Even though there are no recipes to the success of the content you post on the TikTok platform, focusing on your performance while remembering to be funny at times is going to help you increase the number of followers.

#### 10. Post New Content At Magic Hours

Sharing new content at least twice a day will eventually get you a massive following, because it will improve the exposure your videos are getting, but you also have to post videos at the right time. The magic posting hours on TikTok are between 11 am and 5 pm as your followers and their friends are most likely to use the app in that time frame. Get to know your audience and try to understand how frequently and at which hours they're using the TikTok app. This will help you create a posting schedule that minimizes the chances of posting videos during parts of the day when they get the least amount of exposure.

**Conclusion**

Be different, be unique, and provide high-quality entertainment to your followers. Try to offer something fresh that will sweep your audience off their feet. The TikTok app features a nearly endless supply of music and video editing options that enable you to express your creativity freely. However, just producing great videos is not enough to attract large audiences since you also have to employ your marketing skills if you want to grow your fanbase. Which strategies for growing followers do you use? Leave a comment and let us know.
