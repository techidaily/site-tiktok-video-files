## The Essential Steps for Clearance Prior to TikTok Uploads

So, you have successfully created an awesome TikTok video with the perfect dance moves and accurate lip-sync. But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!

The reason?

Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!

This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.

So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?

To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.

And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.

## **Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?**

To avoid getting banned!

You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.

The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.

If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.

To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.

But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?

Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.

## **Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading**

Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it. But this option is only available on desktop browsers.

Here’s how:

**Step 1**

Go to the website version of [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/) from Chrome, and click on “Log In” at the top-right corner of the page. You can also click on “Log In” under the “Following” option on the left.

Here’s how:

**Step 1**

Go to the website version of [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/) from Chrome, and click on “Log In” at the top-right corner of the page. You can also click on “Log In” under the “Following” option on the left.
