## Part 5: Top 5 Highest Paid TikTokers

Before we delve into the richest TikTokers, it is recommended to know what TikTok creator Fund pays to users. So far, TikTok hasn’t officially announced what or how much it pays its creators. The creator fund isn’t a grant or an ad revenue-sharing program. However, influencers who are enrolled in the Creator Fund have reported that TikTok pays them between 2 and 4 cents per 1000 views.

TikTok Creator Fund payout depends on a range of factors in relation to your profile and the content you create. These factors include views count and their authenticity, number of engagement, the region where the views come from, and total followers compared to likes. Performance on this social media platform is dynamic as it changes naturally. Besides, the daily funding amount can differ depending on the number of videos released on that day. So, the specific amount differs from one person to another.

Now that you have an idea of the creator fund payout, you might be wondering about top TikTok creators who have monetized their content. Here’s a list of TikTok’s 5 highest paid TikTokers based on Forbes’ list of the highest-earning stars in 2020:

### 1.Addison Rae Easterling

Louisiana-native Addison Rae is TikTok’s top-earning star who earns $5 million in just a year. With sponsored posts, collaborations with the Hype House and many business opportunities, Addison has reached household name status.

### 2.Charli D’Amelio

According to Forbes’ 2020 breakdown, 16-year-old Charli D’Amelio has earned $4 million. She does sponsored content on TikTok and has also managed to leverage those efforts into large endorsement deals with reputed brands.

### 3.Dixie D’Amelio

Dixie’s fame goes in sync with her sister Charli’s as they appear in many of each other’s videos. With earnings of $2.9 million, she is among the top three on the list. The D’Amelios signed joint deals with many companies and Dixie is striking out on her own with her music career.

### 4.Loren Gray

Thanks to her immense popularity on TikTok, Loren Gray made a casual $2.4 million. In addition to the usual sponsored content and endorsement deals, she has turned her online success into a full-blown music career.

### 5.Josh Richards

According to Forbes, Josh is worth $1.5 million – and it’s not just because of sponsorship deals with major brands. He earns income from his merch line and his own drink business too. Also, he has co-founded his own talent management company.

### Conclusion

Doing what you are passionate about is one thing; making money from it is another. That is what the TikTok creator fund does for video content creators. So, if you trust your creativity, joining the creator fund program might be a lifetime opportunity for you. Maintain a robust content strategy and start earning money through your own content on TikTok!
