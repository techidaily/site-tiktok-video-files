The best tools for advertising are no longer Simple ads or platforms but the latest social media sites like TikTok, which is the best tool to target your audience in a more meaningful and relevant way. Instead, advertising in a creative manner is the current recipe for growth, and so it is better to adapt to the ever-changing consumer preferences regarding content type and channels. Ads should make the brand likable, relevant, and timely — pleasant, not ignored, and repulsive. The TikTok ad campaign, with its many forms, allows brands to take an engaging approach that offers higher user engagement.
