## Part 1: What is Voice Effect?

Picture filters are widely used on Instagram and Snapchat, and we are all acquainted with them. Such filters enable us to add a subtle color change or any other type of modification to our filters. However, because TikTok is all about audio and video, you may utilize voice filters in your videos.

Speech filters are sound effects that enable us to alter our voices. It's worth noting that users can only use the application to apply speech filters to their recorded voice. When you're not using or uploading any recordings, you won't utilize any voice effects.

Built-in voice effects in TikTok include chipmunk, baritone, mike, megaphone, robot, battery drain, shaking, electronic, echo, synth, elf, huge, and acoustic signals.

## Part 2: How to Record and Add Voice TikTok?

**Step 1:** To begin recording your clip, launch TikTok and hit the **\+ (plus symbol)** at the base.

**Step 2:** Press the **Record** button, record your video as usual, and tap it again to stop or end the recording. Once you're done recording, tick the **Checkmark.**
