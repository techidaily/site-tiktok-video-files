On other social media platforms, the acronym stands for Picture for Proof. Thus, it basically is asking a user to send proof of what they are doing.

Aesthetic PFP is the subject that is being searched for by the user. It should tell your followers what the profile is about.

Make sure that the focus of the photo is centered. It should be as large as possible.
