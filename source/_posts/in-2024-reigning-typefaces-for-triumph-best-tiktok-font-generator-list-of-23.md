## How to Customize TikTok Fonts with Ease?

Usually, Tik Tok users can add text in two distinct places. The first among these is the place where you write your bio and enter your username in the application. Here, you can simply cut and paste any text you want. This includes the text you create using a TikTok fonts generator. On the other hand, the second is more complex. It is where you can add text as an overlay to the short videos you create using this application. You can add text to the video only after you shoot your video footage, i.e. – in the second stage of your video creation.

To start the video-creation process, click on the + icon located in the center bottom of your TikTok app. This will bring up the camera view. It is here that you will record the video clips and make some adjustments.

The next stage is where you need to make some fundamental decisions like if you will take videos using the app’s camera or whether you will be uploading other video clips. Also, you have to decide if you will use the flash and if you will record by setting a timer or pushing the big Record button.

Even though the video record screen will allow you to set a few creative options like adding effects, filters, and music to the video you are all set to record, you won’t be able to add text. You will have to record at least one video clip so that you can trim and add it together with other videos at the editing stage. It is at this editing stage that Tik Tok will provide you the opportunity to use text and customize it in your video.

Here’s how you can add and customize your text in TikTok videos-

Step-1: Click on the “Text” option (You will notice the **Aa** symbol above it)

Step-2: Type in the text you want in your video

Step-3: Customize your text by using the options available to you-

* By tapping on the **A** on the left side of your screen, you can highlight your text
* You will be able to change the text’s font through the options listed on the text menu’s top-left side. To change the color, choose an option from the colorful circles at the screen’s bottom

Step-4: when ready, click on **Done** on your screen’s top-right side. Keep in mind that you will be able to change the timing and placement of your text only after this point.

Step-5: Next, drag your text to the area where you want it to appear and then tap on it for more options.

Step-6: Choose **Set Duration** if you wish to adjust the timing of your text on the video. This will bring you to the screen where you will be able to adjust when the text appears and disappears.

Step-7: Tap on the play button situated just above the editing bar to see how your text looks. Once you are happy with it, choose the checkmark in the screen’s bottom-right corner.

Step-8: Click “Next” to simply continue in the video creation process to add a description and any other information you desire. Once done, hit **Post.**

## How do Stylish TikTok Fonts Help You Gain More Views?

As simple as it may sound, using attractive TikTok fonts can help your videos get widely recognized, thus gaining more views. Using interesting fonts can not only increase your reach and help you create more engagement but also get you in front of your target audience.

Content is the King on TikTok, meaning that even accounts with zero followers can get thousands and millions of videos on new videos by using stylish fonts. Customizing your texts with cool fonts help you resonate with younger demographics, thus helping you build brand awareness with people who form to be the majority users in TikTok.

## Edit TikTok Videos with Versatile Video Editing Software

If you think the built-in editor of TikTok can't satisfy your personalized needs, why not try other video editors like Wondershare Filmora? One of the biggest advantages of this software is that its various types of effects will help your videos stand out from the crowd.

Regular updates generally solve issues on the TikTok app. Some mistakes are more prevalent than others. While others emerge relatively infrequently. Although, the more familiar the issue, the more readily it may be rectified.

### 1\. Fix TikTok Bugs on Android

The major cause of this condition is excessive video watching. As a consequence, TikTok collects additional caches, which are kept in the phone memory. As result, there is not enough capacity to conserve phone data, hence TikTok videos are slow, and there are crashing and hanging difficulties.

The remedy to this issue is to clean the TikTok app's caches and data. This approach is based on the steps indicated below:

* Launch the TikTok app.
* Go to your profile page and select one of the three possibilities indicated by three dots.

### 2\. Fix TikTok Not Working on iPhone

To begin, we suggest resetting the **TikTok iOS** app as a general approach. Temporary difficulties that emerged during the app’s functioning may be fixed with a simple restart. As a consequence, these app problems might be to fault for any troubles with getting into your TikTok account. Plus, this is an excellent step to attempt after other changes to begin a fresh new session of the TikTok platform.

To Restart Your **TikTok iOS App**:

* First, close the TikTok app entirely by deleting it from your Recent Apps or App Switcher.
* Then, from your homepage, reopen the TikTok app.

### 3\. Fix TikTok Bugs on Chrome

* As a final option, you may remove the software totally and re-download it for a reinstall.

### 4\. Clear TikTok App Cache

If your TikTok app is not operating, it's probably an issue with damaged cache data. If you notice, your TikTok app plays certain videos offline when you start it. It's not magic. The cache memory saves certain data temporarily to let the software operate quicker and function effectively. If your TikTok is acting improperly, deleting the cached data may help solve it. Follow the instructions below to do so.

* Launch the Settings app from your app menu, then click on the Apps & Notifications.

* From there, click on the option to see all applications. Usually "App details", "Manage Applications", or "See all apps".

![Storage and Cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-4.jpg)

* Finally, press Clear cache to delete the stored data. Now touch the back button once and tap on the Force stop button to quit the TikTok app. After that, re-launch the TikTok app to see whether it rectifies the issue or try another method below.

### 5\. Reset the Network

TikTok has become a very frequently used app globally, however occasionally its users have to confront certain challenges. Sometimes when viewing or recording a video, an error does not allow the app to play the video. This issue is not directly connected to the app; however, we may solve this mistake by utilizing alternative ways such as network difficulties. Sometimes our network is giving trouble to the system, and it is not supporting the videos we wish to play. So, the first and foremost duty to remove this problem is to examine our connection. To solve the connection difficulties or ISP APN, we need to take the following steps:

* Open the settings and click on the network and internet option. From there, click on the mobile network > Open ‘Advanced Options’

* Click on the access point names and select the three full stops in the upper right corner of your phone's screen.

* Then click on reset to default. After performing these instructions leave the settings, then go to your home screen and switch on the mobile data. Then play the video to see whether the fault is fixed.

### 6\. Restart the Devices

If TikTok works on another device or browser from the list above, your device seems to be the issue. If the issue continues, consider deleting the program and reinstalling it from the App Store for iOS users or Play Store for Android users. The first thing to do in the case of an application problem on your iPhone device is to switch off then on again. To achieve this, these are the steps to follow:

**For iOS:**

* To begin, touch and hold the Power button until you receive the “Slide to Power Off” option on your screen. Then move the slider to the right until the screen on your iPhone or iPad becomes dark.

* Wait at least 10 seconds after shutting off your iPhone before hitting and holding the Power button until the Apple logo shows on the screen.
