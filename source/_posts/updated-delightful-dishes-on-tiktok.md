**1\. How to include filters/Overlays**

Wondershare Filmora has three ways of including filters in your videos.

Open Wondershare Filmora and go to the Effects tab, where you will choose your desired filter and include it in your project.

The second way is by hovering your mouse over the filter you want. You will see a “+” sign and click on it as the filter becomes automatically applied.

The third way seems to be the easiest. You have to drag the filter and drop it in the timeline. The filters will get applied to the entire video clip.

If you edit a portrait video in landscape orientation, you can include some background filters to substitute black bars.

**2\. How to remove filters**

You can use one of these ways to remove filters.

Select the filter within the timeline section and press the delete key on your keyboard.

Alternatively, you can right-click on the desired filter and select “delete” from the menu that appears.

**3\. How to locate filters/overlays**

Filters sorted into different categories like Bokeh, Faux Film, etc., makes it easy to locate them based on the category you want. Head to the effects menu, where you will find types to select.

**4\. How to Customize Filters/Overlays**

With Wondershare Filmora, you are at liberty to change the time taken for each effect applied to the filter.

By default, the length of each filter applied is 5 seconds. However, you can drag the applied effect in the timeline section to increase or reduce the duration.

Changing the alpha opacity of the TikTok anime filter

Alpha opacity determines the transparency of the video, and it has a range of 0 to 100\. Usually, a lower value means that your video is too transparent. Double click on the filter to alter its transparency, then confirm from the preview window. Chang it until you find a better video opacity.

**5\. How to use your favorite filters?**

In the effects menu, right-click on the filter effect and select "**Add to Favorite**" from the menu that appears. Once you finish, go to your favorite section, where you will quickly locate it.
