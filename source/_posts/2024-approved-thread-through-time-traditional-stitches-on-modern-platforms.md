## How to Customize TikTok Fonts with Ease?

Usually, Tik Tok users can add text in two distinct places. The first among these is the place where you write your bio and enter your username in the application. Here, you can simply cut and paste any text you want. This includes the text you create using a TikTok fonts generator. On the other hand, the second is more complex. It is where you can add text as an overlay to the short videos you create using this application. You can add text to the video only after you shoot your video footage, i.e. – in the second stage of your video creation.

To start the video-creation process, click on the + icon located in the center bottom of your TikTok app. This will bring up the camera view. It is here that you will record the video clips and make some adjustments.

The next stage is where you need to make some fundamental decisions like if you will take videos using the app’s camera or whether you will be uploading other video clips. Also, you have to decide if you will use the flash and if you will record by setting a timer or pushing the big Record button.

Even though the video record screen will allow you to set a few creative options like adding effects, filters, and music to the video you are all set to record, you won’t be able to add text. You will have to record at least one video clip so that you can trim and add it together with other videos at the editing stage. It is at this editing stage that Tik Tok will provide you the opportunity to use text and customize it in your video.

Here’s how you can add and customize your text in TikTok videos-

Step-1: Click on the “Text” option (You will notice the **Aa** symbol above it)

Step-2: Type in the text you want in your video

Step-3: Customize your text by using the options available to you-

* By tapping on the **A** on the left side of your screen, you can highlight your text
* You will be able to change the text’s font through the options listed on the text menu’s top-left side. To change the color, choose an option from the colorful circles at the screen’s bottom

Step-4: when ready, click on **Done** on your screen’s top-right side. Keep in mind that you will be able to change the timing and placement of your text only after this point.

Step-5: Next, drag your text to the area where you want it to appear and then tap on it for more options.

Step-6: Choose **Set Duration** if you wish to adjust the timing of your text on the video. This will bring you to the screen where you will be able to adjust when the text appears and disappears.

Step-7: Tap on the play button situated just above the editing bar to see how your text looks. Once you are happy with it, choose the checkmark in the screen’s bottom-right corner.

Step-8: Click “Next” to simply continue in the video creation process to add a description and any other information you desire. Once done, hit **Post.**

## How do Stylish TikTok Fonts Help You Gain More Views?

As simple as it may sound, using attractive TikTok fonts can help your videos get widely recognized, thus gaining more views. Using interesting fonts can not only increase your reach and help you create more engagement but also get you in front of your target audience.

Content is the King on TikTok, meaning that even accounts with zero followers can get thousands and millions of videos on new videos by using stylish fonts. Customizing your texts with cool fonts help you resonate with younger demographics, thus helping you build brand awareness with people who form to be the majority users in TikTok.

## Edit TikTok Videos with Versatile Video Editing Software

## How to Customize TikTok Fonts with Ease?

Usually, Tik Tok users can add text in two distinct places. The first among these is the place where you write your bio and enter your username in the application. Here, you can simply cut and paste any text you want. This includes the text you create using a TikTok fonts generator. On the other hand, the second is more complex. It is where you can add text as an overlay to the short videos you create using this application. You can add text to the video only after you shoot your video footage, i.e. – in the second stage of your video creation.

To start the video-creation process, click on the + icon located in the center bottom of your TikTok app. This will bring up the camera view. It is here that you will record the video clips and make some adjustments.

The next stage is where you need to make some fundamental decisions like if you will take videos using the app’s camera or whether you will be uploading other video clips. Also, you have to decide if you will use the flash and if you will record by setting a timer or pushing the big Record button.

Even though the video record screen will allow you to set a few creative options like adding effects, filters, and music to the video you are all set to record, you won’t be able to add text. You will have to record at least one video clip so that you can trim and add it together with other videos at the editing stage. It is at this editing stage that Tik Tok will provide you the opportunity to use text and customize it in your video.

Here’s how you can add and customize your text in TikTok videos-

Step-1: Click on the “Text” option (You will notice the **Aa** symbol above it)

Step-2: Type in the text you want in your video

Step-3: Customize your text by using the options available to you-

* By tapping on the **A** on the left side of your screen, you can highlight your text
* You will be able to change the text’s font through the options listed on the text menu’s top-left side. To change the color, choose an option from the colorful circles at the screen’s bottom

Step-4: when ready, click on **Done** on your screen’s top-right side. Keep in mind that you will be able to change the timing and placement of your text only after this point.

Step-5: Next, drag your text to the area where you want it to appear and then tap on it for more options.

Step-6: Choose **Set Duration** if you wish to adjust the timing of your text on the video. This will bring you to the screen where you will be able to adjust when the text appears and disappears.

Step-7: Tap on the play button situated just above the editing bar to see how your text looks. Once you are happy with it, choose the checkmark in the screen’s bottom-right corner.

Step-8: Click “Next” to simply continue in the video creation process to add a description and any other information you desire. Once done, hit **Post.**

## How do Stylish TikTok Fonts Help You Gain More Views?

As simple as it may sound, using attractive TikTok fonts can help your videos get widely recognized, thus gaining more views. Using interesting fonts can not only increase your reach and help you create more engagement but also get you in front of your target audience.

Content is the King on TikTok, meaning that even accounts with zero followers can get thousands and millions of videos on new videos by using stylish fonts. Customizing your texts with cool fonts help you resonate with younger demographics, thus helping you build brand awareness with people who form to be the majority users in TikTok.

## Edit TikTok Videos with Versatile Video Editing Software

If you think the built-in editor of TikTok can't satisfy your personalized needs, why not try other video editors like Wondershare Filmora? One of the biggest advantages of this software is that its various types of effects will help your videos stand out from the crowd.
