## Part 2: How to Make Reaction Videos with Filmora

Even though you can make **TikTok reaction videos** using its own filters and audio mixing tools that work pretty well under ideal conditions, if you are a perfectionist and like precision in anything you do or create, you need a dedicated program that has been designed specifically for the purpose.

Although several such tools are available in the market and can be easily downloaded and used, the best among them is Filmora by Wondershare. Wondershare Filmora is an industry-standard production and post-production tool for both Mac and Windows PCs that the majority of users prefer over its competitors such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X, etc. This is because Filmora offers simple UI, is less resource-intensive, and is able to render the outputs significantly faster.

You can learn how to make **TikTok reaction videos**  using Wondershare Filmora by following the steps given below:

**Note:**  Before proceeding, make sure that you have already copied the source (and the reaction) video(s) from your smartphone to your computer.

**Conclusion**

A **TikTok reaction** enables you to make the source videos more fun and entertaining. Luckily the app itself has a “React” button that helps you create **TikTok reaction videos** with merely a few simple taps.
