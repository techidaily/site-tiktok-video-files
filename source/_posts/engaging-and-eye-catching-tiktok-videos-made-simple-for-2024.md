That is where TikTok video templates come in. They are ready-to-use assets you can edit and personalize to make original videos quickly. By using templates, you can stand toe-to-toe with other content creators on the platform.

If you've been using TikTok for a while, you've probably seen excellent videos with unique voice-overs and sound effects. You might have imagined that you would also be famous and feature on some popular platform if you possessed these abilities.

We are going to talk about these audio effects on TikTok videos today. We'll show you **How to Change Voice on TikTok** and apply voice modifications there, as well as on a popular and widely used third-party software. So, let's get the ball rolling.

#### In this article

01 [Voice Effect Introduction](#part1)

02 [Record and Add Voice TikTok](#part2)

03 [Available Voice Effects in TikTok](#part3)

04 [Change Voice for TikTok Videos in Capcut](#part4)

05 [Change Voice from Female to Male in Filmora for TikTok Video](#part5)

## Part 1: What is Voice Effect?

Picture filters are widely used on Instagram and Snapchat, and we are all acquainted with them. Such filters enable us to add a subtle color change or any other type of modification to our filters. However, because TikTok is all about audio and video, you may utilize voice filters in your videos.

Speech filters are sound effects that enable us to alter our voices. It's worth noting that users can only use the application to apply speech filters to their recorded voice. When you're not using or uploading any recordings, you won't utilize any voice effects.

Built-in voice effects in TikTok include chipmunk, baritone, mike, megaphone, robot, battery drain, shaking, electronic, echo, synth, elf, huge, and acoustic signals.

## Part 2: How to Record and Add Voice TikTok?

Your video must feature your voice to apply Voice Effects. You can't utilize Voice Effects in films created with built-in themes, including audio, for example.

**Step 1:** To begin recording your clip, launch TikTok and hit the **\+ (plus symbol)** at the base.

**Step 2:** Press the **Record** button, record your video as usual, and tap it again to stop or end the recording. Once you're done recording, tick the **Checkmark.**

**Step 3:** Select **Voice Effects** from the drop-down menu on the upper right.

![record tiktok video with audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-tiktok-video-audio.jpg)

**Step 4:** Tap to hear every one of the effects as the window opens up from the bottom. When you wish to utilize one, pick it and move your finger away from the screen. Tap **None** on the far left when you don't want to employ an voice effect.

**Step 5:** After that, you may add any extra effects to your movie, such as text stickers. When you're finished, tap **Next**. Proceed to choose your Post choices, save the video, or touch **Post** as you would with any other video you've made.

![change voice effect in  tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-voice-effect-tiktok.jpg)

## Part 3: Available Voice Effects List in TikTok

TikTok has several Voice Effects that allow you to change your voice. You may explore something entertaining because you can listen to each one before deciding to utilize it.

* **Sound waves**: Synth-like in tone, but with a more digital edge.
* **Giant:** Like a large, joyful monster, heavier than baritone.
* **Helium**: Chipmunk's voice is louder pitched.
* **Synth**: Imagine 80s music with a synthesizer added to your voice.
* **Echo**: There is an echo in every word or statement.
* **Electronic**: Your comments were accompanied by a smattering of electronic noises.
* **Vibrato:** A vibrating tone, as if your voice were trembling.
* **Low Battery**: Slow and deliberate, as though your battery is running low.
* **Robot:** You seem just like a robot, as you could expect.
* **Megaphone**: You sound as though you're whispering into a megaphone.
* **Mic:** How you would appear if you were speaking into a real microphone.
* **Baritone**: Masculine and profound.
* **Chipmunk**: Like another one of Alvin's Chipmunks, it's high-pitched.

CapCut will question you about the movies and photographs in your photo library that you'd want to import into the composition when you're in this mode. After that, the program analyzes your video and recommends a variety of designs, which each alters the music, timing, and changes.

For instance, you may add a pop rhythm, disco groove, or urban funk flavor to your film. CapCut allows you to select from a licensed library of songs or import sounds you've recorded.

Here's how to change the voice on TikTok using Capcut:

**Step 1:** Open the **Capcut application** on your phone and I**mport** a video/audio file or record a short sample.

**Step 2**: Now tap on **Add Audio** to record a **Voiceove**r.

**Step 3:** After recording, now press on the **Checkmark** to save the sample.

**Step 4:** Now tap on the recorded area on the **Timeline** to enable the **Voice Effects**.
