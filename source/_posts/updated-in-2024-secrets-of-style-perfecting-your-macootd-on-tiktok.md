After Vine had been shut down a few years back, it left a gaping hole in the heart of the users. But, later on, they discovered TikTok. It is a social media platform where users post short 15 seconds video clips. The video ranges from dance challenges to pranks. In fact, you will also find videos of pets dressed funnily.

TikTok is a social media network that had a meteoric rise. The platform saw a significant rise in creative short sketches that are similar to Vine skits.
